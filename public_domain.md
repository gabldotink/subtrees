# Public Domain

Any creation published as Public Domain belongs to everyone and can be used in any way without conditions, not even crediting the author.

[1] Subject to local laws

[2] Unless proven that it was unrightfully released as Public Domain.

[3] In practice, you can effectively revoke status of your own Public Domain work if you manage to relicense it before anyone else obtains a copy. That includes, for example, deleting relevant commits from a public git repo to prevent someone from fork the project from that commit and relicense it from there.

[4] Whoever obtained a copy of it while under Public Domain can still use that specific version however pleases. Github forks for example.

[5] At least when licensed under [CC0 1.0 Universal - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) [1] which contains:

 > "No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document."

## Controversy

In general, open-source advocates do not sympathise with Public Domain arguing that it allows for open-source software to be copyrighted and relicensed under closed-source licenses, which is true. They prefer copyleft licenses such as [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) which enforce any derivative work to remain open-source.

## Profitable Public Domain Software

* SQLite - A free, reliable, portable and [most widely deployed](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) database engine in the world. While its engine code is open-source and Public Domain, the automated test code isn't. Tests are paramount in ensuring reliability and performance of database engines. Since SQLite [has 711 times as much test code than engine code](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html), competition is strongly discouraged in face of the daunting task.

## Patents

Patents apply to inventions, not creative works. Having said that, in general it seems that one can retain Patent rights even after licensing their work as Public Domain:

* [CC0 1.0 Universal - Public Domain Dedication] license contains:

> "No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document."

## Popular Public Domain equivalent licenses
