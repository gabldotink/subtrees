## Controversy

In general, open-source advocates do not sympathise with Public Domain arguing that it allows for open-source software to be copyrighted and relicensed under closed-source licenses, which is true. They prefer copyleft licenses such as [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) which enforce any derivative work to remain open-source.

## Profitable Public Domain Software

* SQLite - A free, reliable, portable and [most widely deployed](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) database engine in the world. While its engine code is open-source and Public Domain, the automated test code isn't. Tests are paramount in ensuring reliability and performance of database engines. Since SQLite [has 711 times as much test code than engine code](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html), competition is strongly discouraged in face of the daunting task.

## Patents

Patent disputes are always detail-driven murky waters and I wouldn't risk significant financial damages based solely on a license, Public Domain included. A lawyer specialized on the jurisdiction of your interest really is the only reliable source of information. Having said that, in general it seems that one can retain Patent rights even after licensing their work as Public Domain:

* [CC0 1.0 Universal - Public Domain Dedication] license contains:

> "No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document."
