# Var

Var is a variable that allows you to set the variable and be able to redefine it multiple times, below is an example of redefining variables

```javascript
var x = 200
x = 300

//I declared x once then redeclared  it and set the new value to 300!
```

This variable type is useful because it allows us to reuse it multiple times, unlike other variable types like let, and const which cannot be redeclared more than once.



So in s4d we can create a variable named my name and set it to John, - in this example we are going to use prefixed commands. Before we start we need an event listener which in this case is on message received, then we add our logic - If set my name to Anny - notice we have redeclared this variable now it is no longer John!, then we print the new variable value which will output Anny.
