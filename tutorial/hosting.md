This is the token you use from step 7. of [bot.md](bot.md "mention")

## Hosting

You already made some working application and want to host it? Sure

You can use Many websites providing free hosting

One of the user friendly and basic one is [replit.com](https://replit.com/)&#x20;

or you can use websites like [railway ](https://railway.app/)or [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)



### Hosting on Replit

1. Create a new Repl
2. Select Language as Node.js & name it whatever you want
3. Here you put All of your exported files, export is not the .s4d file

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/test_bot.zip" %}
You can use this if you want
{% endfile %}

4\. Make sure to put all files from the folder and you are done. You can now run your bot!

{% hint style="danger" %}
If a bot's repository is on a [repl.it](https://replit.com/) free plan, your code is forced to be open-source

> If you don't use [[#process.env](hosting.md#process.env "mention")](hosting.md#process.env), your token is usable by anyone, read [#negligence](hosting.md#negligence "mention") if you don´t want to use them
{% endhint %}

### process.env

Secrets are [environment variables (`.env`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment\_variable) and they are unvisible to others.
