## Hi there 👋
We make you more productive, by advising, empowering and teaching highly efficient software architectural fundamental concepts, 
that are tightly integrated with their existing tool chains. As also offer that under The Unlicense. So it is a fundamental part
of building unlicensed Software.

It bundels knowleg from Inovativ Companys and Open Source Projects into Fundamentals that will not break. To allow you to code software
with more confidence and a incremental upgrade path that always works. Get less often broken by changes from projects you depend on that
are not feature dependend like refactorings and other meta updates that are not realted to the code that you use.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

- 🙋‍♀️ Main Offer The Unlicense Code Editor delivered as Devtools Extension.
- 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
Make a Pull Request see what happens.
- 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
This is build on High Level Concepts to abstract the obvisios and keep the meaning full.
- 🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
I am on a diet.
- 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
