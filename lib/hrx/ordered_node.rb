require 'linked-list'

# A linked list node that tracks its order reltaive to other nodes.
#
# This assumes that, while nodes may be added or removed from a given list, a
# given node object will only ever have one position in the list. This invariant
# is maintained by all methods of LinkedList::List other than
# LinkedList::List#reverse and LinkedList::List#reverse!.
#
# We use this to efficiently determine where to insert a new file relative to
# existing files with HRX#write.
class HRX::OrderedNode < LinkedList::Node

  # The relative order of this node.
  #
  # This is guaranteed to be greater than the order of all nodes before this in
  # the list, and less than the order of all nodes after it. Otherwise it
  # provides no guarantees.
  #
  # This is not guaranteed to be stale over time.
