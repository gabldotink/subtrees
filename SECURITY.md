## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security issue or vulnerability in any of the projects of [this
organisation](https://github.com/webcomics/), don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use either GitHub's [security vulnerabilty reporting
   feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
or contact me via my [private contact addresses](https://github.com/TobiX).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
