With the Instant Articles Builder, you are able to specify the template for your [Instant Articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com/) simply by pointing and clicking on the visual elements of your mobile web articles. This template is used to map the content in your mobile web articles to Instant Articles, which will then be rendered to your readers within Facebook's mobile apps.

For using this tool you'll need:

*   A website containing articles.
*   A Facebook Page enabled to use Instant Articles and connected to your website.

The file produced by this tool should be uploaded to a public URL and referenced by a meta tag inside the `<head>` tag of your articles:

`<meta property="ia:rules_url" content="path/to/your/rules-file.json"/>`
