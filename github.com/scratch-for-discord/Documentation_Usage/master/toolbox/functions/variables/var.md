# Var

Var is a variable that allows you to set the variable and be able to redefine it multiple times, below is an example of redefining variables

```javascript
var x = 200
x = 300

//I declared x once then redeclared  it and set the new value to 300!
```

This variable type is useful because it allows us to reuse it multiple times, unlike other variable types like let, and const which cannot be redeclared more than once.



So we can create a variable, that will set when the bot starts, named `MyName` and set it to `John`, notice we have redeclared this variable now it is no longer John!, then we print the new variable value which will output as `Anny`.
