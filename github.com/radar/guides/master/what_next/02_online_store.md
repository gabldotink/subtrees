# Online T-Shirt Store

Your project is to build a small working example for an online store that sells T-Shirts. The store should have these features:

* People should be able to sell T-Shirts of different colours and sizes in the store.
* T-Shirts should have an image to show the t-shirt.
* There should be an interface for users to manage T-Shirts. Do not worry about stock management for the time being. This interface should be off-limits to any regular user.
* Users should be notified about their order's details once it has been placed through email.

The process of buying the T-Shirts should go like this:

1. Viewing a list of T-Shirts
2. Viewing information about a particular T-Shirt
3. Adding a T-Shirt to the cart
4. Checking out the cart
5. Emailing the user that their order has been completed

## Evalulation

This application will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. Compliance with Ruby syntax rules.
2. Demonstrated understanding of Rails best practices
3. BDD/TDD tests written in either RSpec or Minitest.
