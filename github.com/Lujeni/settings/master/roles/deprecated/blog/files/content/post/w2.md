One of my oldest merge request was integrated this week o/.

I use a little bit AWS and the `elb` service more especially with HTTPS.

However, the module was not idempotent. AWS API return the certificates content with some special caracters (e.g. carriage return).

Not the best and pythonic [solution](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/427cfd61620fb3fa423b7c06f4a2a0866796ca77) but it works.
