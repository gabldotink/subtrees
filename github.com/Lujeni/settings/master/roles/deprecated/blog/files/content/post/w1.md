> I'd like to help ansible, how to start ?

One of the most common answer is the **documentation**. It's a simple way to became contributor, Ansible documentation is community project too !

I use my own way to test ansible module, however Ansible propose `hacking` [tools for that](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/hacking).

Since the extra/core modules [repository merge](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/repomerge.html), i wanted to retest this `official` way.

Bingo, [typo](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/021756a6917790cd9a5fa91d1bd29dbec2ebeef7) in the README :).
