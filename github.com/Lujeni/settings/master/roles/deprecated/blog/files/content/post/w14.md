Weâ€™ve been running few AWS servers in production for several years now in my company. For a special use case, [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) hosting was choosen. The pricing for a BareMetal SSD is very attractive.
<br />
<br />

There is a "stateless" firewall system in Scaleway (Security Groups) but imho it's limited and apply a new rule could be slow. We decided to replace Scaleway SG by a software firewall: [UFW](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)
<br />

So, What does this have to do with Ansible ?
<br />
<br />

Since the 0.35 version of UFW, you can add a comment on your rules. However, the ansible module missing this feature :). [Problem solved](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/24981) ! (after the review/merge)
