I'm back in the hood (~2 weeks in Laos) !

This week I propose a new AWS module, [iam_cert_facts](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/24451) retrieves `iam_cert` details using AWS methods.

You can gets various details related to IAM cert, ARN, expiration, certificates content...


Very quick and nice review from the Ansible/AWS guys. o/
