I missed one week ! Was to busy to prepare my next holiday.

To make up for it, I thought I'd give you 2 contributions ;p


- [Ez to test&close](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17555)

- More and more review of current issues. [This one](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/20762) seems fixed but i am waiting an `Member` approval.



After two months of contribution, i realise the importance of a simple review.

Many opened issues are already fixed in the devel branch.

Mostly "contributions" consist to reproduce and confirm a bug.
