The ansible `pip` module is quiet a mess.

Imho, the code is not easy to review and the possibility for a snowball effect is big.


This [pull request](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/19688) is not yet merged.

However, [two](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/20983) [issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19028) could be closed.


It was the first time i broke the ansible CI (e.g. shipable). o/

Good timing to learn a new layer of the ansible ecosystem.

After a short discussion with a core developper, it's pretty easy to launch the integration tests. 
There is a python script that will fire up a docker instance to run the tests in using the Ansible source from the same checkout you are running ansible-test from.

```
sudo ./test/runner/ansible-test integration --docker  centos7 pip
```
