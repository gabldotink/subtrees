It had been some time since grouping the mongodb modules make sense.

2 steps:

- [moving the mongodb stuff](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22187)
- [update bot ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/pull/397#event-984269667)


**UPDATE**: 1/2 merged

**UPDATE 2017-03-13**: 2/2 merged

I broke the CI again ! But the part of the problem is that the tests don't account for modules being moved. it's treating them as new modules and applying the new standards.
