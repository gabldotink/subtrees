### **Introduction**
I used ansible since 3 years ago.
In my company, Ansible became the puppet killer and now we try to automate all kinds of stuffs.
I saved huge amount of time with this framework, so i deciced to be more active in the community to thanks you and maybe inspired others people to use or contribute to Ansible.

### **How**
Basically, i will try to contribue to the source code with **one pull request/week**.

For this purpose, i will be focus on some parts of the code:
* target modules that i already use/know
* documentation
* tests others pull requests

At the time of writing, there is *1 406* issues and *698* pull requests.
I guess, i can find something to fix in this pile of problem :).

A post blog will follow each pull request if i'm not too lazy !

Keep in touch.
