**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

I am [private] of the book.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

The work is a book, The Linux Programming interface, of which I am [private]. Information about the book can be found on my website, http://man7.org/tlpi/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

There are currently 728 forks. Each of these appears to contain a copy of [private] book as well as several other copyrighted works.

Skipping through the list of forks alphabetically, there are copies of [private] book in all of the forks listed below.

Note: I looked at 17 forks selected somewhat at random. (I looked at the first fork for the first alphabetically listed user in the numbers/letters "0" and "a" through "p".)

Every one of the forks that I looked at contains a copy of [private] book. I would assert with some confidence that [private] book can be found in all or nearly all of the forked repositories.

Based on the representative number of forks that I have reviewed and listed in this notice, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

Therefore, disabling the entire network would be appropriate.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

Remove the content, and in all of the forks.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
