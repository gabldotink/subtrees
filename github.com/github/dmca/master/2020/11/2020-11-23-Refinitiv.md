**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am from the Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) at Refinitiv. Refinitiv has ownership of this code. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We cannot provide internal code, but this is the GitHub in question:  
https://github.com/sriharipakalapati/Jenkins/blob/3fda0ed5ba112d43b788a5a5219a245da022ad77/Jenkinsfile

It includes internal Refinitiv code base, API keys, and internal references. This user who created this page no longer is an employee at Refinitiv.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take down the repository https://github.com/sriharipakalapati/Jenkins

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have not found any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is internal work that should have been produced on our internal GitLab. Instead this was posted on GitHub.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be the removal of the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have the user's contact information. The user is no longer employed at Refinitiv.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
