I [private] East Arctica's "JS-Plugins" repository and the project that was made with it.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copywritten code is a series of scripts designed to assist with completing quizzes on many popular quiz sites. Our main/official repository is https://github.com/EastArctica/JS-Plugins

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This repository is a copy of ours with all of our credits removed (see "East_Arctica" changed to "AfroYousef" in nearly every file) and needs to be taken down entirely: https://github.com/AfroYousef/JS-Plugins

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This is a unique case.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. It is licensed under a proprietary license that does not allow modifications and redistribution which are being violated by this repository.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

It may not be made private. Remove the repository and expunge all of its data. Redistributing + modifying the JS-Plugins/EAScripts code is a violation of its license.
