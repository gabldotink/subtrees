GitHub has reversed the takedown notice previously processed and published at: 

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md

The parent repository made changes in response to the takedown notice, and based on [additional information](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf), GitHub has determined that the notice does not meet the requirements of our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy). Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject this notice with respect to the parent repository and weâ€™ve reinstated that repository: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl. GitHub will reinstate forked repositories that make similar changes. If you have been affected by this takedown and have any questions, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://support.github.com/contact).
