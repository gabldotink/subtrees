Dear Github DMCA takedown notice representative,

I am sending this request on the owner’s behalf to represent EAB Systems (Hong Kong) Limited ("EAB" ), the copyright holder.

We, EAB Systems (Hong Kong) Limited, (http://www.eabsystems.com/), have sole proprietary ownership of the source codes of the project EASE for our client with AXA Singapore ("AXA SG"). These source codes have been uploaded publicly by someone who appears in Github as 'dannyyuen123456789' without our authorization and must be taken down immediately.
EAB’s In-house repository contains all detailed history and during the projects’ course of development. As the details are very long, we are providing sample screen shots here. We would be glad to arrange a time to show you the details via a video call if that helps.

Firstly, please find the EAB-AXASG contract and AXASG's email.
