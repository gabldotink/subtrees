From the description text:  
Widevine is a Google-Owned DRM system that's in use by many popular streaming services (Netflix, Spotify, ...) to protect media content from being downloaded.

But Widevine's least secure security level, L3, as used in most browsers and PCs, is implemented 100% in software (i.e no hardware TEEs), thereby making it reversible and bypassable.

This Chrome extension demonstrates how it's possible to bypass Widevine DRM by hijacking calls to the browser's Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) and decrypting all Widevine content keys transferred - effectively turning it into a clearkey DRM.

It is our belief that the repo as a whole represents a circumvention tool in violation of 1201 and therefore needs to be removed.

Additionally, the Git repo contains several files that violate Google’s copyrights:  
Google license_protcol.proto (see Google copyright at the top of the file): /widevine-l3-decryptor/blob/main/license_protocol.proto  
Copyrighted Widevine documentation distributed to Widevine licensees:  
Widevine Modular DRM Security Integration Guide: /widevine-l3-decryptor/blob/main/docs/WidevineModularDRMSecurityIntegrationGuideforCENC.pdf  
Widevine DRM Architecture Overview: /widevine-l3-decryptor/blob/main/docs/Widevine_DRM_Architecture_Overview.pdf

In addition to this request, we have filed a separate Sensitive Data takedown request of this file: /widevine-l3-decryptor as it contains the secret Widevine RSA private key, which was extracted from the Widevine CDM and can be used in other circumvention technologies.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be removed as it contains code that enables circumvention of DRM technology and unauthorized access to copyrighted works.
