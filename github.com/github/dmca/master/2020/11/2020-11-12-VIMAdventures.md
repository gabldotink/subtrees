**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of an online game VIM-Adventures (https://vim-adventures.com). Everything on that site is [private] and copyrighted to me and my company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I own a website https://vim-adventures.com that I programmed and created. It's a paid for game. Someone paid for a license, and then uploaded to github all the minimized html, css, javascript files, graphics and data responses from the server for free. Even in the README [private] said that [private] doesn't own the copyright, that it's mine. The repository was created to serve my copyrighted material, and even package it as a docker image with github actions. The repository contains all that was stolen and replicates my work without paying for a license. I contacted the user and [private] removed the repository, but a lot of forks are still out there and need to be removed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
