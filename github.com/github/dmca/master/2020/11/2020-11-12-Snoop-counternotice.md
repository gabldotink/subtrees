1. The "BDFull" file is located in the repository with open source license: https://github.com/snooppr/snoop/blob/master/BDfull. Therefore, its use is regulated by the open source license of the repository. Thus, infringement of the closed license Snoop Full Version is out of question.

2. My repository does not use Snoop code, it is a direct fork of https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock. The Snoop project is also based on Sherlock (https://github.com/snooppr/snoop/blob/master/COPYRIGHT#L66), so our code and data formats are similar.
