Hello!  
  
I am [private], the [private] at Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions Russia and a member of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG) Security department. I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
A few days ago our team accidentally discovered that 23 November 2019 the source code of commercial software were published under the https://github.com/dartiin account. I allege that all of the content at https://github.com/dartiin/carbazar, https://github.com/dartiin/mwc, https://github.com/dartiin/stax-v2, https://github.com/dartiin/ice-9, https://github.com/dartiin/stax, https://github.com/dartiin/XRide-e-scooters infringes.  
  
The owner of developed software is Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG). Source codes in these six repositories were initially developed by Telekom Innovation Laboratories (also called T-Labs) or governed by T-Labs. T-Labs is the R&D unit of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTAG).  
  
This source code is proprietary and not published.  
  
DTAG did not authorized the user dartiin to upload and post those source code and documents to the public GitHub repositories.  
  
This source code is proprietary and not published, so we can’t provide a public link on it. Please tell us how could we better proof of owning these repositories, if proofs below are not enough.
