**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The repository is a graded assignment for a scholarship program that is compiled 100% by myself.  
In South Africa, there is no requirement for registration of copyright for written and published work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The user forked my repository and changed the name to submit is as his own unique work. He did not contribute anything although attempted to convince me that he had made some improvements to one of my bash files. Since the submission date of the assignment I noticed that my entire repository was forked, not one thing changed or a single contribution. I asked him to remove it and he removed only 2 folders. He did not remove the others to avoid not submitting a project of his own. I then filed a DMCA request, however, am refiling since the circumstances have changed. His repository has been marked and even starred, although it is my work. The user's first language is French, his English is poor and could not have compiled a similar work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, but only this one is infringing as it was renamed and submitted as his own.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

If it is not taken down, he should remove any association with the scholarship program or the project. As well acknowledge me as the author with the original repository name.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
