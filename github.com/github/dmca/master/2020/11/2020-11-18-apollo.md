Yes, I am the copyright holder.

I am currently working on a Minecraft client that can be found here https://github.com/Ic0vid/apollo. In addition to this client I offer a base for other developers to use and build a client off of. However when the use this base they agree to the copyright I have on my repo https://github.com/Ic0vid/apollo/blob/master/LICENSE

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Another repo that can be found here https://github.com/GopineClient/gopine-client has used this base and other iterations of my code to create a new client. This would be fine however they are in violation of GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 I have in place by not keeping the license and copyright notice and stating there changes

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The developer did have a fork of my source code by has since removed it from his account [private]  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

They are in violation of GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 used in my source code that can be found here https://github.com/Ic0vid/apollo/blob/master/LICENSE

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

My code should be removed from the repository or my license and copyright notice should be place back on said files with changes
