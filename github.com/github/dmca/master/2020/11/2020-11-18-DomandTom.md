[private] for Dom & Tom. I am acting on behalf of the company and our intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A user in my organization unarchived a repository without making it private. It was then forked by another comapny, located here: https://github.com/laravellib/argonne-hpc_interface_app

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repo: https://github.com/laravellib/argonne-hpc_interface_app

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, it was forked here: https://github.com/laravellib/argonne-hpc_interface_app

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

We have the license marked on composer.json as proprietary, and they copied it with the same, including our developer's information.
https://github.com/laravellib/argonne-hpc_interface_app/blob/master/hpc-interface-app/composer.json#L9

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We're asking the repository be removed as soon as possible.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unfortunately not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
