**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not searched, but for now, please delete this code asap. This is proprietary application code. This was mistakenly put on Public Git by a contractor who no longer works at Catalent.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is no open source license, this is Catalent's proprietary information.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No, do not want to make it private. I need to remove/delete this code, the person is no longer employed at Catalent, and has no authority to place this code in public git.
