I am the copyright owner of the Waldorfschrift font (look at Waldorfschrift.de) and therefore I want that you delete the free download of the font at

https://github.com/mondora/shareourbreak/blob/master/css/fonts/waldorfschrift/waldorfschrift-webfont.ttf

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
