This is a DMCA counternotice requesting the restoration of my repository ejohnson9912/proctoring-research, in response to the DMCA notice posted at github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-19-Proctorio.md. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The disabled content was located at github.com/ejohnson9912/proctoring-research.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake. The disabled content consisted of code snippets used for purposes of research, education, commentary, and criticism regarding Proctorio's product and its representations to the public. Proctorio's complaint does not account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair use doctrine. Proctorio's additional allegations of "reverse engineering and unauthorized hacking" are both untrue and irrelevant to its claim of copyright infringement.

My name is [private], and my address is [private], [private], [private].  I can be contacted through my attorneys at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, [private] ([private]) and [private] ([private]).  EFF's phone number is [private].

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located, and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
