**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

AB Trav och Galopp owns the copyright in the source code that has been posted at: https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/.  
I am a full time contractor with AB Trav och Galopp and am authorized to act on their behalf in this matter.  
The repository this query pertains to contains code written by us and which has never been subject to any type of open source licensing. It is code that clearly belongs to us as it contains references to our internal repositories and tooling.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This repository of ours, which is private, contains the code we have written and never released for free:  
[private]  
Specifically this file clearly is a later version of the file that we are asking to be removed:  
[private]  

One easy way to see this is to look at this line, which contains a reference to our private container registry at AWS:  
[private]   
There is a corresponding line in the offending repository which I will provide in the next field.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository:  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/

All files within it are code that belongs to use and not released under any type of open source license.  
Here you can easily see that this code contains references to our organisation's private container registry at AWS:  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/a51ab1357db0ab8b30077f8d8f2dac226714136e/yaml_generator.py#L27  
You can also see that is contains static references to our Github account:  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/a51ab1357db0ab8b30077f8d8f2dac226714136e/yaml_generator.py#L21  
Along with references to many of our repositories:  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/a51ab1357db0ab8b30077f8d8f2dac226714136e/yaml_generator.py#L66  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/master/ignore.txt  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/master/monthly.txt  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/master/nightly.txt  

Also there are plenty of references to organisation specific secrets and api keys:  
https://github.com/puresauce21/yaml_generator/blob/a51ab1357db0ab8b30077f8d8f2dac226714136e/yaml_generator.py#L33

This is clearly not code that should exist outside of our organisations private repositories and it is also clearly code that never has been released as such as it is copyrighted by us and very specific to our environment.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. This is the only repository we could find and it is not a fork.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The code should be removed entirely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

According to the patch note for the user's latest commit it is [private]  
https://github.com/puresauce21/blc_react_node/commit/e72d641576b5254f405fd0236ad05e6c9fc80588.patch   
We have reached out through email with a friendly request to have the code removed, as we do not believe it has been published with malicious intent and the code seems to have been pushed once and then forgotten about, but we suspect the email address along with the github account may have been abandoned as there is a sudden stop of activity after August and we haven't gotten any reply to our messages.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
