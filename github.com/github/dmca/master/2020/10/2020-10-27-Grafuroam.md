https://github.com/Soapbosnia/Grafuroam-SAAF-Clusterfuck - this repository contains Lua scripts that were leaked from my Multi Theft Auto gaming server called Grafuroam.

Some background

I suspect that a hacking tool was used to achieve this result. The tool dumps client-side Lua scripts when they are downloaded from the gaming server to the Multi Theft Auto client and are about to be interpreted (executed). The tool was published in hacking forums on the internet and was designed to be used with Multi Theft Auto (since it is a popular multiplayer platform). As far as I know, the tool is now blocked by Multi Theft Auto developers. The files must have been leaked in a timeframe between the hacking tool publication and the ban by Multi Theft Auto developers.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licenced under any licence because it is a private asset. The infringing (client-side) files were leaked from my gaming server and were not licenced to be used or distributed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The infringing files should be removed from the repository. Making repository private is not an option.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
