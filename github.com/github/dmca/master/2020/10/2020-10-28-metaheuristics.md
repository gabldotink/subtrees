**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I am an instructor on Udemy. A GitHub user posted screenshots of my slides and my codes to his account.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

On a course on Udemy that I created. The course has been unpublished, so the link won't work. I am working on updates so will republish it in a couple of months. Screenshots were taken from my presentations and codes I created.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I don't know if there is to the URL above if it's a post

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It's copyrighted under Udemy

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I wish that URL gets deleted.  
I emailed and talked with the person who stole my work and uploaded it. He apologized and said he removed the public branch but he is not able to delete this link --> https://github.com/zzsza/zzsza.github.io/blob/b03868c0b9b5aaa00ab3dc9b135434681d0746b6/_posts/2019-04-01-simulated-annealing.md  
I want this link taken down, please.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Again, I talked with him, he said he does not know how to delete that link. So please do not terminate his account, as I asked and he responded nicely. All I want is for that link to be removed.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
