**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Copyrighted university homework that includes substantial portions of material distributed privately at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The solutions posted on GitHub derive from sample code provided to the students as part of the course work.

The code, lecture material, and the homework specification are posted on Canvas LMS with no public access (i.e., restricted to enrolled students). Therefore, we don't have a public URL.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/SourceNZ/Compsci-335-a1  
https://github.com/dollypigeon/Compsci-335  
https://github.com/godsapple/compsci-335

In each of the cases, it is the entire repository that infringes our copyright. As I mentioned above, the source code derives from the sample code which is our copyright.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Making the repository private is sufficient. Public solutions hinder the learning process of current students since they are tempted to copy solutions without understanding. If the repositories are private and are only shared with those who need it (e.g., their prospective employers), that would be absolutely fine. (And thank you guys in advance for making these repositories private. Cheers, [private])

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, but these are ex-students.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
