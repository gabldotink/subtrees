I created a Repository named “pythonChris” about 3 years ago, which contained the company’s important source code and the internal information.  
When I realized that information would be leaked, I deleted this Repository immediately.  
But this user named “helloexp” has completely forked my Repository ,and it still exists now. And I couldn’t contact him.  
The following is his GitHub’s URL about my forked Repository:  
https://github.com/helloexp/pythonChris

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository "pythonChris" should be taken down, the URL is:  
https://github.com/helloexp/pythonChris

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched the allegedly infringing repositories, and now I only find user helloexp has forked "pythonChris".

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This work isn't under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I think the best solution is to remove the forked repositories. There are no any changes and he can't made this repository private, because this repository contains import internal information and source code about my company. It shouldn't be open in the public net.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

His Github name is helloexp, and his email is : [private]
