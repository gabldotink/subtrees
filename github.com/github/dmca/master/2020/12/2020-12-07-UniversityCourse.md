Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I created slides for a university course. By mistake I put these slides on my personal web page in the GitHub repository [private]. Later a user NoXLaw forked the repository with my personal page to https://github.com/NoXLaw/tashoyan.github.io.  
However I do not have right to make these slides publicly available. This is a part of my agreement with the university. I have already made my repository [private] private, but the forked repository is still there.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The slides are here: https://github.com/NoXLaw/tashoyan.github.io/tree/master/workshop-streaming  
The slides contain materials for the university course "Streaming Data Processing". I prepared these materials for my teaching at the university.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The fork of the repository containing my home page should be deleted: https://github.com/NoXLaw/tashoyan.github.io.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I found only one fork: https://github.com/NoXLaw/tashoyan.github.io.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The fork should be deleted: https://github.com/NoXLaw/tashoyan.github.io.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Here is a home page mentioned in his GitHub profile: [private]  
This home page mentions an email address: [private]  
I already wrote to this email address, but got no response.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
