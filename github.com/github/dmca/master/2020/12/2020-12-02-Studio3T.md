We sell a commercial software product, Studio 3T, the professional GUI for MongoDB. We offer a free 30-day trial which is available on our download page: https://studio3t.com/download/. After the 30-day trial, users can purchase a Core, Pro, and Enterprise license from our buy page: https://studio3t.com/buy/.

We've set up license checks at the end of the 30-day trial to effectively control access to our copyrighted material.

We've seen multiple GitHub projects that have circumvented these license checks by manually tweaking the 30-day trial timestamps and bypassing the license checks, or publishing step-by-step instructions on how to do so. This is in violation of our software's End User License Agreement.

"The Customer is entitled to a 30 day free trial of the Software (other than NonCommercial Edition Software Software) for the purposes of deciding whether or not the Software meets its requirements (“Evaluation Period”)."

otherwise does not wish to enter into a paid up Subscription, then the Customer shall destroy the Software and all copies, in any form including partial copies or modifications of the Software received from the Supplier or made in connection with this Subscription and all Documentation relating thereto. Any rights granted to the Customer to use the Software shall cease."
