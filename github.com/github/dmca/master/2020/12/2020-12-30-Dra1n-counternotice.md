**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The project was owned 50/50, both my name and [private] are the registered authors.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/CharlieWhile13/Dra1nMirror

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The project was initially [private]’s idea. Initially the code base was agreed to be at equal work. It quickly became apparent that I had become a ghost writer on the project, owning 90% of the code on the repo.

After not being paid for the work I did, over a period of just over 2 months, I made a mirror of the original repo, [private] (which was subsequently deleted), and open sourced it. We agreed from day one that the code would be open source from day one.

After a strong lack of communication from [private], between unpaid money, no communication as to why it wasn’t open source yet, I did it myself. I own 90% of the code on the repo, the ownership of the project/app is “equal”

After many disagreements, and Mega being banned from certain communities because of how I was treated, we agreed that: “The mirror repo could stay up if I removed the api url’s from the source”. I did this, and all seemed *ok*.

Now about a week later, this claim has been filed, which in my opinion is completely unjustified.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
