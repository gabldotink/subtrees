Hello Dear Github:

I am [private].It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform,and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get GitHub's support and resolution.  
We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I created the repositories named signin2.0 on my git([private]),and then found some one cloned and reuploaded the repositories after we removed,which contained many sensitive information such as algorithm,system configuration,belonging to the my data assets,so we hope GitHub as soon as possible to help us completely remove the repository and thank you very much!.

The following are Github's URLs and Screenshots about our forked Repositories:   
https://github.com/wanggn/signin2.0

The following is my information:  
name: [private]  
Address: [private]  
Email: [private]  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
Hoping for your response,and thanks again.
