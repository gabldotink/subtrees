I am a [private] of Myda Pte Ltd, Singapore. We hired a freelance developer via [private] claiming to be from [private]. A month later and following the first payment of $750, we discovered the freelancer is in fact stolen someone's identity from [private] and is in fact from [private]. We ceased our contract with him immediately and requested him to provide his identity given the fact that he has been given access to repositories and confidential information. The freelancer refused to share his original identity, demanded $10,000 or else he would publish the code he has written, our copyright, and the code written by us if we do not pay him $10,000. We refused and he has uploaded copyright material of Myda Pte Ltd to his Github Account and published them.
