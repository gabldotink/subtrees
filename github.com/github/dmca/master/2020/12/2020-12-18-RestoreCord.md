**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of RestoreCord. Released1337 leaked the source code of RestoreCord, which is very clear by the line "This is the old restorecord source and i decided to leak because im bored.." in README.md. I request that this repository be removed ASAP.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work was a PHP website. Again, Released1337 has leaked my source code without my permission. I am protected by copyright, which disallows Released1337 to do this, hence why I'm requesting this repository be removed ASAP.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository as it all violates my copyright, https://github.com/Released1337/RestoreCord-Source-DiscordBotRestorer

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is NOT under an open source license. Once again, I am the owner of the work and I didn't grant anyone, including but not limited to Released1337, to post my source code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository must be removed. It can not be privated, as Released1337 will just public it again. Also, if possible, a blacklist would prevent Released1337 from uploading the code again after it is removed. Thank you.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private] on discord. He refused to remove repository and then proceeded to block me.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
