**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the rights holders to code created for a chrome extension, which as been hosted at [private] way before an of these other versions using our code were posted. Please see in our account how the code predates these other parties. And how they make use of our same code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Like many startups, we use platforms to share our source code ([private]) which as part of the terms of service all work is confidential/under nda.   Regardless, we are the owners of the code. It is most likely we talked to these candidates about making freelance modifications of our source code, and they obtained the code that way, which isn't even publicly available in the chrome store, proceeding to upload it to github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
 
https://github.com/princez1214/chrome_extension  
https://github.com/mobilizer4you/Chrome-Extension-Vue.js

Both of the above parties uploaded our extension to create the repository. Note the first one modified sharing with 25 contributors. It is very concerning. And note

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't found any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licensed as open source, or for any usage. This is our custom code.  
in the directory:  
core/  
there are webpack.org files that are open source.  
also  
twitter.com_sample_files/ it's record of twitter's page as our extension parses it, so if they update pages we can refer back to it. we don't own that.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal of the repositories.  
They should not make available our extension or modified versions of our extension.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not. Again the way this was likely was procured, since our extension is not in the chrome store, is through sharing it through [private] to do development on it. Please note that that site has a NDA and code can't be used in this manner, Regardless, whether it was via [private] or not, it all is copywritten material we are the owner of and they should not be using this for their projects or making available for others.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

Confidential for github staff, if possible we'd prefer this is not disclosed to the infringing parties since we don't know if they are crazy:  
[private]

**Please type your full legal name below to sign this request.**
