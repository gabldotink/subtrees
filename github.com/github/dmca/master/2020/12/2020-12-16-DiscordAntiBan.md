**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My friend [private] and I own the source code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The Repository owner has leaked the source code which is being sold. He was not authorized to publish the source code, and he didn't even buy it, He scammed me for it, and me nor my friend who own the source code gave him permission. The repository URL is https://github.com/Dualisc/DiscordAntiBan.

Here are some pictures which suggest the repository owner did not have permission to upload the code, and did so maliciously.

Also on my friends website [private], which shows up frequently in the repository, my friend is selling this code as he is the owner. The repository should be removed ASAP.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository. Again the repository URL is https://github.com/Dualisc/DiscordAntiBan. The repository has zero ownership of this code, so my friend and I therefore demand it be taken down.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks. This was uploaded without permission and must be removed immediately.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not an open source loader. The repository owner holds zero ownership and the repository needs to be taken down.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository deleted completely, and possibly a blacklist to prevent this code from being leaked in the future.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do, he refuses to remove, obvious from the discord image links I provided above.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
