Yes, I am the copyright holder.

Hi, I'm [private] of LUBUTEAM, a company specializing in the development and sales of source code. I recently discovered that my source code is being illegally shared on Github by a FreeSourceGit user. This violates our Terms & Conditions and intellectual property.  
It greatly affects our business

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our source code is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please help me immediately remove any offending source code. These are our business products, it is forbidden to share this in violation of our copyright and intellectual property.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't know this person, he used a fake Facebook account and spread the code everywhere. I think he is one of the competitors of our company.
