**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I got a report and discovered our codes were published by our former intern in 2015 or 2016. As [private], I'm obliged to manage this case and ensure the risk of being attacked (or reputation) through published source code can be minimized.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It was a long time ago and we couldn't get the original repository. Since it contains our brand and past codes, it might impair our brand by potential publication mentioning that our source code is leaked.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/muhamadrizkiy/automation-unit-test/

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

It was a long time ago and we couldn't get the original repository. Since it contains our brand and past codes, it might impair our brand by potential publication mentioning that our source code is leaked.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

I believe no, just need to get the link to be removed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

It needs to be taken down since the person should have not published the code.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
