**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the content owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private], known online as [private], and I am authorized to act on the owner's ([private], known online as [private] or [private]) behalf. The owner is the initial publisher of the Dra1n app's source code, which is available at https://github.com/CharlieWhile13/Dra1nMirror. This has also been taken down due to a DMCA takedown request. The owner is the author of the infringing code.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

According to the public DMCA takedown request (available at https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/12/2020-12-04-dra1n.md), the user who submitted said request stated that "this project is a private repo that was shared the the developer there is a license not allowed to distributed". The owner of the repository ([private], my repository is a fork using GitHub's fork feature) has given me full permission to act on their behalf regarding the code and has stated that the private repository mentioned has no license. [private]'s repository had GNU's General Public License version 3, which allows myself and anyone else to distribute said code/the repository as a whole. The reason that my repository was taken down is completely false and I would like my repository to be reinstated.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
