Dear Sir or Madam,

I request the deletion the listed repositories according to the DMCA Takedown Policy.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The mentioned repositories contain unauthorized copies of the PIPython software driver developed by our company. This driver is delivered by us explicitly in combination with hardware to customers and can be used only for this purpose.

Both the ABOUT section of the repositories, the contained source files and especially the contained license text clearly refers to our company. The whole repositories are an exact copy of our driver. Additional information can also be found on our website:

https://www.physikinstrumente.com/en/products/motion-control-software/programming/

My request for deletion refers to the following repositories:

https://github.com/alex0130/PIPython

https://github.com/capnTP/PIPython

https://github.com/danrauch/PIPython

https://github.com/nik849/PIPython

https://github.com/rhuygen/PIPython

https://github.com/specialcanadian/PIPython

I request the deletion of the complete repositories, since every single file infringes our copyright and there is no other way to remedy the infringement.
