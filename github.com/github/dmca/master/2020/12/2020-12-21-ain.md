Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am developer on a https://ain.ua/ project. My account is in the list of collaborators of https://github.com/alexzubkoff/ain.ua repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/alexzubkoff/ain.ua is a cloned version of the private repository of project https://ain.ua/ . [private] worked on this project 3 years ago and had an access to a [private] private Git repository. As I noticed yesterday, he published the copy of this private repository in a public Github repository for some reason, but he was not supposed to do this. By doing this, he violated the NDA which he signed. I tried to contact him but he never answered.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/alexzubkoff/ain.ua

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I've checked. This repository doesn't have any forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No it is a cloned private repository

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

As a temporary solution the repository can be made private. But the best solution is to delete it from Github, it can consist some sensitive information as API secret keys etc.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
