**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I released this software under the MIT license - https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest

This individual decided to fork the code and only modified the license ignoring the restrictions set out by the MIT license - https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I submitted a PR to the repository in question that reverts the license changes asking the individual kindly to comply with the MIT license for the code that he did not produce. https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/pull/1

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/blob/master/COPY.FOSS  
https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/blob/master/LICENSE - needs to be reverted to MIT license  
https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/blob/master/README.md  

All the changes have been detailed and reverted in this PR - https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/pull/1/files

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No other forks identified.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The files were released under the MIT license, this repository is in breach of that license by removing the license and replacing it with another license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Ideally revert the offending commits, no need to remove the fork. This PR can be merged to restore the original license - https://github.com/FOSS-Archive/SideQuest/pull/1

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

None other than that available on the updated license - [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
