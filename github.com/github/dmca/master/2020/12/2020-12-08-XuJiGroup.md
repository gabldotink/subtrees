Hello Dear Github:  
We Are  
   Xu Ji Group.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform,and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get GitHub's support and resolution.
   
   We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

   We created the repositories named scdmanager and cjk on [private],and then found some one cloned and reuploaded  the repositories after we removed,which contained many sensitive information such as algorithm,system configuration,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so we hope GitHub as soon as possible to help us completely remove the repository and thank you very much!.  
   The following are Github's URLs and Screenshots about our forked Repositories:
