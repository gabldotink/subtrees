We have tried to contact the account owner but due to lack of contact details we were unable to do so. I have a good faith belief that use of the data/information mentioned above is not authorized by us, our agents or by law.

Hence, we request you to take down the entire projects named: Quickkart-Angular & Quickkart-MVC which can be found at https://github.com/luckykluther02/Quickkart-Angular & luckykluther02/Quickkart-MVC: mvc (github.com)  permanently from this Github account without leaving any trail or back-up in the GITHUB systems.

Given the criticality of the matter, we urge you to take this request forward expeditiously and would require an immediate action from your side.
