Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Hello - I have two repositories that are private. They are core code for a business I own. The web address is www.ThriveMES.com.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I hired [private] to help our project with some overflow work. I am from the [private], [private] is from [private]. In October 2020 he became non-responsive. Yesterday my lead developer found that our private code base was copied to someone elses account and posted to the public. The account is https://github.com/ArtemSetnik. We have no idea who this guy is or how to reach him. . But we see through his starred accounts he is affiliated with [private]. These two repositories have proprietary information and passwords.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Both repositories should be taken down.  
https://github.com/ArtemSetnik/Thrive-TCOM  
https://github.com/ArtemSetnik/Thrive-DCS-PHP  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks. They literally just copied and pasted it.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Im hoping it was a mistake and https://github.com/ArtemSetnik is unaware of the implications.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. I'd love to have the contact information myself because Im hoping its just a misunderstanding that I can address through kindness. There is no benefit to him making it public so I think it was a mistake.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
