**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Rochester Institute of Technology is the owner of this copyrighted work. As an employee of RIT Online involved with management and delivery of RIT’s edX content, I am acting on behalf of the Institute in pursuing content removal under DMCA.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The posted content comprises test questions copied from the Cybersecurity MicroMasters program courses on edx.org. These are graduate-level courses in Cybersecurity developed by faculty at Rochester Institute of Technology. These courses are eligible for credit if learners successfully complete and pass all five courses in the MicroMasters program and are accepted into the master’s degree program at RIT in Computing Security (MS). Detailed descriptions of each of the courses and the Cybersecurity program can be viewed at the links below.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/jivoi/junky/tree/master/edx_CYBER501x  
https://github.com/jivoi/junky/tree/master/edx_CYBER502x

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have not identified any forks from these repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, this is not licensed under an open-source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

RIT would recommend that the files are removed completely to protect the academic integrity of the MicroMasters program content. Graded assessments are locked from free users on the edX platform and even partial removal (of only the question) would be a threat to the academic integrity of the program. Additionally, posting of the answers is in direct violation of the edX terms of service. https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
