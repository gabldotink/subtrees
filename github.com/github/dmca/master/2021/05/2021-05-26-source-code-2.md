**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I [private] two repositories called "[private]" and "[private]" in 2015, which contained creators, contents and domain name(com.[private]) are all owned by the company I work for. Later found that before I deleted, users named fbion, bingli-borland, jqmtony and newfaceofme had completely forked my entire repositories, and the repositories still exist now.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Sorry, I have deleted my original copyrighted work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/fbion/bim_project  
https://github.com/fbion/framework_project  
https://github.com/bingli-borland/framework_project  
https://github.com/jqmtony/framework_project  
https://github.com/newfaceofme/framework_project

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have searched and checked these forked repositories, and all the files are from my previous repositories, including the last committed information.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, because it's the product of my company, not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since they contain the company’s important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, which belong to the company’s internal data assets, so I hope GitHub could help me completely remove them as soon as possible, and thank you very much!

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, so I need your help.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
