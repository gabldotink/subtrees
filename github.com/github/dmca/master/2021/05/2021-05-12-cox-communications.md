**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

As an employee of Cox Communications and member of the Cox Communications Security Operations Center, I am beholden to CCI (Cox Communications) in cases where internal CCI API and sensitive information is leaked, such as this.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The listed files contain copied code from an internal CCI project ([private]) which was posted publicly on Swaggerhub. It has since been taken down, but the owner of this repository is not a CCI employee and has a copy of one of the files from said API documentation (v1.yaml) in the "nodejs-typescript-boilerplate" repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ersanyamarya/nodejs-typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/docs/api/v1.yaml

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Currently, there are no forks of this repository (nodejs-typescript-boilerplate) listed.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the original work was not listed under any open source license nor was the original code written to be used in any open source projects. It appears this user is unintentionally copied the original repository.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

All copies of the "v1.yaml" file should be removed, as they contain references to internal CCI API that should not have be exposed. The easiest way for this to happen would be for the repository to be deleted to ensure all copies of said file (in the blob and history) are deleted.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
