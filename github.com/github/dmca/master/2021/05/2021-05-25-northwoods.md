To GitHub's DMCA Agent

This is a takedown notice sent on behalf of Northwoods Software Corporation pursuant to Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice at https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice.

I have recently learned that GitHub is making available some copyrighted materials of Northwoods Software Corporation without its permission.  Those materials are being made available in the GitHub repository named "BugMyGod/GoJS".  The materials have been modified contrary to the license agreement governing use of the software, which prohibits modifying the software or creating derivative works.

The original materials, that are owned by Northwoods Software Corporation and protected by copyright, can be found at:  
    https://gojs.net/2.1.34  
or at:  
    https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS  
Those materials include, but are not limited to, the following documents:  
    https://gojs.net/2.1.34/release/go.js  

The infringing materials are in the GitHub repository "BugMyGod/GoJS" in the folder:  
    https://github.com/BugMyGod/GoJS/tree/master/  
The infringing documents include but are not limited to one or more of the following documents within that folder:  
    https://github.com/BugMyGod/GoJS/tree/master/release/go.js  

The distribution of our unmodified software via GitHub's web site and servers is not a problem for us.  The distribution of a modified copy of our software is what we cannot accept.

Please remove and disable all access to the files hosted by GitHub at:  
    https://github.com/BugMyGod/GoJS/tree/master/  
and all of its contents and their archives, for all versions, immediately and world-wide.

I provide this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that the rights of Northwoods Software Corporation are being infringed, even after taking fair use into consideration.  I declare under penalty of perjury that this notice is accurate and that I have the authority to act on behalf of Northwoods Software Corporation.
