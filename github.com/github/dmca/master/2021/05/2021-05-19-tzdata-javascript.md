**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice."

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."

I [private] code. It has not been released under an open source license.

As it says under "Copyright" on http://tzdata-javascript.org/ :  
"You're only allowed to use the library, if you load it from this site as specified under Load the library above."  
"The data files are created by a simple conversion from the official tzdata. Since the original data from tzdata are public domain, so are the converted data files."

This DMCA request is only about the code of the library, not the data files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Original URL:  
http://tzdata-javascript.org/tzdata-javascript.js

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Since those are derivative works based on my file, I would like those removed as well.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't found any other copies of my file on your site.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

My file is not under an open source license, but the repository in question claims that it's under the MIT license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be to have the file and the derivative works based on that files removed. It's not open source.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have their contact information, but their github username is "prantlf".

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
