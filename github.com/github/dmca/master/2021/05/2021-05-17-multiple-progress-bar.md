**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Recently at [private], I contacted (Ticket ID: [private]) about the stolen code of my repository https://github.com/GeniusRUS/MultiProgressBar  
When contacting, I indicated the thief's repository and also one fork from him. But inadvertently missed the second fork and it stayed. I believe it should also be removed because it violates my repository license and does not list me as the author

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am [private] of the original library. Development history visible in commits since 2019  
https://github.com/GeniusRUS/MultiProgressBar

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Phoenix-626/MultipleProgressBar

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, that's all

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Since this is a fork, there was also a violation of the original license of my original repository https://github.com/GeniusRUS/MultiProgressBar  
I have an Apache license, and here is MIT

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I see the only way out - deleting the repository with the stolen code. If [private] wants to use my code, then let him fork my repository with attribution and freely modify, distribute it, as indicated in the license I have chosen. I am deeply convinced that this was done deliberately in order to appropriate the authorship of this code for himself and, thus, improve his GitHub profile and, thus, deceive his colleagues and potential employers with other people's merits. And with that said, all forks of this repository should be removed. Therefore, this repository must be deleted and, if Phoenix-626 wants, can fork my original repository with all rights and licenses respected.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, i have't. His profile is not contains email or another contact info  
https://github.com/Phoenix-626

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
