Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for John Deere. We previously contracted with a company to provide software development. In the agreement, code was the sole ownership of John Deere. A resource on that engagement has stored associated code in their own personal repository and exposed it publicly.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Entire repository under "https://github.com/MohammedIrfan777/Spring-Boot" should be removed. All code under this repository is property of John Deere, as can be witnessed by the package structure and comments within many of the files. The code under this repository was written for John Deere Supply Management. Exposing it causes risk to John Deere as it contains proprietary information as well as application credentials and personal information.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks shown via Github interface.

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Repository and history must be deleted. Contractual agreements between John Deere and the contracted company state the code should not reside on any servers other than those of the contractor and John Deere.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
