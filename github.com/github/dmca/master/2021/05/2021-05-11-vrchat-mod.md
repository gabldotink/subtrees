**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am currently the holder of the copyright as it is work licensed and created [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It is a mod for a game called VRChat. It purposefully disables some of it's content under certain conditions to prevent cheating/the ruining of others' experience. The work can be found here: https://github.com/loukylor/VRC-Mods/releases/download/PL-1.2.11/PlayerList.dll. Its source could also be found here: https://github.com/loukylor/VRC-Mods/commit/fe9d66103c9191762eb4687872f906d614755655. Please note that this is not the latest version of the mod as this version specifically was used for copyright infringement.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The file that should be taken down can be found here: https://github.com/xSyste/VRCMods/blob/main/PlayerList.dll. I would prefer the entire repository be taken down as it contains the work of other modders, but I am not authorized to speak on their behalf.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks that I am aware of.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

My work is licensed under GPL-3.0 and the infringed work is in full violation of the license as it does not follow a single condition that GPL-3.0 specifies. The infringed work is also not licensed under anything.

GPL-3.0 brings forward 4 conditions over the use of software licensed under it:

1. License and copyright notice, this is not met.

2. State Changes, no changes are clearly stated, although it could be assumed it is an "unlocked" version from the readme.

3. Disclose Source, no source is disclosed. Only the compiled software is shown.

4. Same license, there is no license on the github repo.

The user would have to follow all 4 of these conditions in order to use my work in their repository.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only difference between the original work and infringed work is that it removes the aforementioned disabling of content within the mod. This goes against what the point of the mod is, and my own philosophy. This small difference is not enough to prove the infringed content is allowed under fair use. Thus, I believe the only solution would be to remove the content completely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, the account looks to be some kind of throwaway, and I do not know who is behind it. The only information I have is that the accounts username is xSyste.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
