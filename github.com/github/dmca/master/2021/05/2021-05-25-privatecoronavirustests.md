The information I have about the infringer is their Github username: cristianjy  
They have also used the email address [private] and phone number +[private]

They worked with us through the [private] platform using a fake profile. [private] disabled their account and they have been attempting to blackmail us for money with a threat to publish our private repos if we don't pay, which they have now done. There are also multiple other repos of ours in their account they have published I will be issuing DMCA for.
