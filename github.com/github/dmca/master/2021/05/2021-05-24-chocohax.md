Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] for Lynx Collective which are the owners of ChocoHax Anticheat.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our work (ChocoHax) is an anticheat on a framework known as FiveM. ChocoHax is not an open sourced project and it is sold encrypted to server owners.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We would like all of the files removed before they start to impact our revenue. Below are links to each repository containing “cracked” copies of our anticheat.

Repo 1: https://github.com/UsernameOffical/ChocohaxLTD  

Repo 2: https://github.com/maciasexe/chocohax10_cracked  

Repo 3: https://github.com/Palacios06/ChocoHax  

Repo 4: https://github.com/chopo156/ChocoHax--HentaiCore  

Repo 5: https://github.com/Mexalucard0/chocohax10_cracked

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, all forks and repositories containing our anticheat have been identified above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Chocohax is not an open source project.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would like it removed as it goes against our terms of service and these public repositories can be used by cheat developers to develop bypasses for our anticheat which would effect the sole purpose of it.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unfortunately not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
