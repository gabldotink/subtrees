**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

There is a person who registered his rights to the "GameCMS" web script and due to this he is trying to cross our path. However, the name of our project is "UNI GameCMS" and he finds fault with the name of our project and wants us not to use this word "GameCMS" but we cannot do this, because this is our project and people have been using it for a very long time.

If you look at the size of the GameCMS repository, then you can see that its size is over 100 MB, while UNI GameCMS is only 25 MB in size.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**
