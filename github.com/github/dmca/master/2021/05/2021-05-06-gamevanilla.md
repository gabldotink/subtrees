Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is not licensed under an open source license. The assets are sold under the terms of the Asset Store EULA: https://unity3d.com/es/legal/as_terms. I am the copyright holder of this asset, as stated in section 9 (Copyright) of the EULA.

The repositories need to be removed or, alternatively, made private.
