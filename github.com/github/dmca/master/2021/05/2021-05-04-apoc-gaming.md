**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the minecraft network APOC Gaming. We have had 3 programmers for the last 6 years working on custom plugins for our network, and sometimes paid outside devs to help fix issues faster. These devs took it upon themselves to steal our projects source code and post it on github without our permission. All of our projects source code is private, i used to host it on github and paid for a pro account to keep all of our repos private. I moved to [private] a while back and everything on our [private] repos are private as well.

I can provide screenshots for proof of ownership/access to these repos. But in the commit history of both repos my name should be in there as proof.
I can also provide a repo backup of our current repository. But our current commit history only goes back 4 years from when we switched from github to gitlab.
 
Offending repositories:  
https://github.com/daddysboy2001/APOC-Payday  
https://github.com/Ratismal/Payday  

As you can see here, my config commit is on both of these repos.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Everything. They copied the entire repository and uploaded it to their public github account. In one case the offender blatently "debranded" all mention of APOC in the plugin from the source code, and then added in his own copyright/license into the source code. Which i find hilarious to say the least. Steal from someone then put in a notice telling others not to steal it.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files in the repository.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

These are the only ones that im aware of. Unless you are some way able to do an in-depth search.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, all of our projects are closed source, not meant for the public eye. Lots of minecraft networks out there to compete with. Because everything was privately programmed and hosted, it did not have any public license attached to it like a GPL or MIT.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Complete removal of any source code from APOC is the only source of action i would like. Making it private does not fix the fact our dource code was stolen and posted on another account.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
