Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the book made available for download here on GitHUb that was published with the publisher Érica (São Paulo: Brazil). The book is sold in retail. However, in addition to my work, other violations of other authors.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/xstpl/Livros-1/blob/master/Estudo%20Dirigido%20de%20Linguagem%20C.pdf

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/xstpl/Livros-1/network/members

Based on the representative number of forks you have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. There are a total of 144 forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is copyrighted.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Total withdrawal of the material, because if there is someone who can distribute it "free" it is myself with authorization from the publisher.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I did not find the contact on GitHub or elsewhere.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
