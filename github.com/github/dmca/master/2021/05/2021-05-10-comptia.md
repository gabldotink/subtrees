**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I'm sorry but I am not aware of such terms.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is copyrighted and cannot be used publicly. It's for cybersecurity professionals and can be accessed with credentials only.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove it or make it private so it does not appear on the Internet (Google search etc).

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. I don't see any contact details on their profile. Here is the link to their profile.
