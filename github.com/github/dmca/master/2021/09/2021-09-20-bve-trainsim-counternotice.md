Original content developer team https://bvets.net/uchibo/ says as below  
- "hope this will help you develop your own map and rolling stock on BVE Trainsim."  
- There is no need to contact the author when creating add-ons or material data for "BVE Trainsim" by diverting or modifying the distribution of "BVE Trainsim Uchibo Line". (Originally written in Japanese as, "「内房線製作チーム」による「BVE Trainsim内房線」の配布物を流用・改造し「BVE Trainsim」用のアドオンや素材データを制作する際には、作者に問い合わせを行う必要はありません。" )

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The takedown notice says "Yes, I am the copyright holder." I believe it is false. Because of the four files pointed out, three of them and one of them have different authors, not just one.

The original authors of these three files can be found at the bottom of https://bvets.net/uchibo/. We recently contacted the development team of the original content. They confirmed that they have no problem redistributing derivatives on GitHub, and that they have not submitted any takedown notices.
