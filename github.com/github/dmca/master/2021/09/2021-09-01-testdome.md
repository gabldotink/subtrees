I have a good faith belief that the source code snippets identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, they breach the copyright clause of TestDome's Terms of Use:

Files found online are our (TestDome) templates for candidates to implement their solutions in so original authorship is split for all files. But, as candidates agree to our Terms of use before taking a test where they assign ownership of their solutions to us (TestDome).

Since the content is behind a paywall, I have attached a screenshot of each question with a visible URL.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.

Thank you for your kind assistance.

Truthfully,
