**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We created these files and this man is threatening us to try and get us to pay him crypto to take down the files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://thirdfort.com  
We are the agency who is designing and building the website.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/mercury-business/thirdfort_live_version

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The developer just wants us to pay a fee to him as he's blackmailing us. He said he will put all our client files online if we don't and he will notify each client so I get fired. Please see his email threat below.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is all custom code - they are just stealing it to be nasty.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We just need this to be taken down. His account should also be closed. He's also got an account under "[private]" and he is keeping our files there and he has also taken our own website files as a threat.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Only his email address and he's provided a fake ID and National Insurance Number
