**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**
 
Yes, I am the copyright holder.
 
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**
 
[private] of @TeamUltroid.
 
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
 
https://github.com/TeamUltroid/Ultroid  
https://github.com/TeamUltroid/UltroidAddons  
https://pypi.org/project/py-Ultroid/ (GitHub repository is private).
 
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
 
https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/Humanoid  
https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/HumanoidAddons  
https://github.com/InternetAmethyst/humanoid - our private codes, in public, without consent.
 
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
 
Yes.  
https://github.com/Noob-Stranger/Py-Humanoid which is a fork of our repo with private source code, and must be taken down.
 
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**
 
AGPL-v3.0 or later.
 
- https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/Humanoid : As the GNU-AGPL suggests, the repository should "State changes" from the parent repository. The alleged repository is a copy of https://github.com/TeamUltroid/Ultroid and does not state changes.  
Also, as per the license goes, "Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it" - this repository does not preserve author attributions, and the righful code owners are not mentioned anywhere.
 
- https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/HumanoidAddons: This repository is a one to one copy of https://github.com/TeamUltroid/UltroidAddons, which is contributed by around 19+ members (devs as well as the to-be devs/parent repository users having an interest to code), and comes under the same AGPL-3.0 license just like TeamUltroid/Ultroid.
As stated above, the alleged repository does not preserve author attributions, nor states changes from the parent repository. The rightful people who own the codes they use are left without mentions and authorship.
 
- https://github.com/InternetAmethyst/humanoid - This repository contains private source codes, which must not be present publically on github. We are the owners of the real source and this alleged repository must be taken down.
 
To conclude, the organisation https://github.com/TeamHumanoid is a one to one copy of https://github.com/TeamUltroid, with copied codes, missing attributions and even similar organisation names. 
 
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**
 
https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/Humanoid and https://github.com/TeamHumanoid/HumanoidAddons must either get their attributes fixed, and must follow the license properly, or must be privatised/deleted.
 
https://github.com/InternetAmethyst/humanoid, being private source codes, must be deleted.
 
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
 
No.
 
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
 
**I have taken fair use into consideration.**
 
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
 
**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.**
