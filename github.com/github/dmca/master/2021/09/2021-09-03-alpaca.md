I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Copyright infringer(literal website design clone with web3 phishing):  https://www.alpacaairdrop.live/  
Copyrighted work that has been infringed: https://www.alpacafinance.org/

What would they need to do to remedy the infringement: Take down the site. This is a scam phishing attack so this is a moot point. However, I am following the Github instructions and including this.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
