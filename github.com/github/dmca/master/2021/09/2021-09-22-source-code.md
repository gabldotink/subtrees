 yes, I distributed this under GPLv3 license, but these repositories violated GPLv3 license.

 GPL license is supposed to display contribute history(GPLv3 7.c).

but the these repostories did not follow it and manipulated the commit history to post it as if they had produced it.

This is a violation of the GPL license because it did not clarify the contributor of the project.(Contributors include those who provided information using issue trackers.)

 - On README.md, indicate the original repository and indicate that this repository has been forked from it.

 - (Ethical issues, not necessary) Notify README.md that this project is deprecated and **very dangerous** to use.
