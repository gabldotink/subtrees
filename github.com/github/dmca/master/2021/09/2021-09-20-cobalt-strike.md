**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] for Cobalt Strike at HelpSystems LLC  
HelpSystems owns the Cobalt Strike brand and all related intellectual property

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Cobalt Strike software  
This includes (in the main repo below as well as the ones listed under forks), decompiled source code (Java) and/or cobaltstrike.jar (which is the jar file that contains the compiled classes).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/mai1zhi2/CobaltstrikeSource (this entire repo contains decompiled Java classes and the whole thing is infringing our copyright)

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Note that while these are not forks of the repository above, they are all separate repositories that contain either decompiled Cobalt Strike Java source code and/or cobaltstrike.jar. I'm including these here as instructed in the note above, rather than submitting multiple takedown notices:

The folders “client/opt/cobaltstrike” and “server/opt/cobaltstrike” contain copyrighted material and both folders need to be removed. The rest of the repo is unrelated to Cobalt Strike: https://github.com/l4ckyguy/ukn0w


As far as I can see (as it’s in Chinese), the folder “%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/cs4.2/cs4.2no” (the top folder in the repo, then “cs4.2/cs4.2no”) contains copyrighted material and needs to be removed. I can’t see any other folders in the repo that need to be removed: https://github.com/MRLEE123456/record


This repo doesn't seem to be related to Cobalt Strike, but there is a copy of the product in the folder linked below which needs to be removed:
https://github.com/Esonhugh/esonhugh.github.io/tree/9b569ae29699e4b949c0158f1a237827a1fb7d68/back

 

The following repositories contain cracked copies of Cobalt Strike and/or decompiled Cobalt Strike Java code. In each case, the entire repository violates our copyright and needs to be taken down:

https://github.com/Fl4g-Pshacker/cs

https://github.com/Fl4g-Pshacker/cs4

https://github.com/sqlsec/uptmp

https://github.com/jsonor1896/tools

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licensed as open source. It is violating the terms of the commercial license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Complete removal of all repositories noted above, except for the three repositories where I’ve referenced the specific files/folders that need to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have it.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

I work from home and as such, don't want to provide personal details. Email would be preferable if possible. Work related contact information is as follows:
