**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm fully authorized to act on behalf of Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co., Ltd., the copyright owner of the work described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

SenseTime owns a registered copyright named “General Image Processing SDK software V1.0” relating to its license products named “SZMobileImageSDK” in China, and the copyright registration number is 2016SR247963. Source codes and all information of the above registered copyright, which are all developed by SenseTime itself and should be proprietary and confidential, are released by a certain third party (username: sdm845) and posted into repositories below in Github without SenseTime’s authorization. We affirm that the entire repository below is infringing SenseTime’s copyright as it contains source codes of SenseTime’s products which are exactly the same with that of SenseTime’s registered copyright. Thus, it is very possible that SenseTime’s products codes are leaked and are posted by the certain third party into Github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We assert that the entire repository below is infringing SenseTime’s registered copyright and hope it to be removed. The URL of the repository is:
https://github.com/sdm845/pnx_sprout_dump

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched for forks of the allegedly infringing repositories, and no fork is found up to now.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These source codes are not licensed under any open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please help us remove the above repository which infringes SenseTime's rights by reproducing substantial portions of SenseTime's internal and proprietary source codes. Specifically, enter “sensetime” in the search box in the above URL of the repository and press Enter, you’ll find the links to the encrypted source codes package with the corresponding license product “SZMobileImageSDK” owned by Sensetime.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We don’t have any contact information about these Github users, and we hope you can provide to us if you do.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
