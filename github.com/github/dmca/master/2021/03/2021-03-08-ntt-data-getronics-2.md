**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The infringing files are our copyrighted work, as is evident from the copyright remarks ”Copyright (c) 2014, NTT DATA Getronics Corporation.”  
The infringer illegally took them out of development libraries and leaked to GitHub, together with copyrighted files of other companies including Mitsui Sumitomo Banking Corporation (SMBC), etc.
