**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

I am [private] for COMPSCI 186 (formerly 190D) at UMass Amherst, and I hold copyright on original course materials [private], including programming assignments. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

The original copyrighted work that is being infringed is at https://people.cs.umass.edu/~liberato/courses/2017-fall-compsci190d/assignments/; there are several assignments that the named repositories, below, contain in whole or in part. In particular, assignments 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 on that page.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  

https://github.com/pdnagraj/Bus-Game

With the exception of the README.md file in each, the entirety of each repository is infringing my copyrighted material.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, also: https://github.com/amdreamer/DNA-Sequence-Assembly

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

No, the code is not open-sourced.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

Yes, a private repository would be fine!

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  

**I have taken fair use into consideration.**  

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
