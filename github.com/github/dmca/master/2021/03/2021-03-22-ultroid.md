Respected Github Administrators,

Our team worked for months behind this repository - https://github.com/TeamUltroid/Ultroid  
and he cloned our repo without any License & Violating AGPL License within some days of release.  
He even copied the pypi package, which weren't public yet (because of some issues, we decided to release later on) and denies to give credits, and abuses when asked to privatise or give credits. I'm done asking him politely. Please just ban such people. 

His copied repo - https://github.com/TeamBlackShark/BlackShark  
Our pypi pip package which were copied and uploaded without permission - [private]

The whole repo is a one to one copy of https://github.com/TeamUltroid/Ultroid. Please ban such License Violators, they make developers hate the opensource community.
