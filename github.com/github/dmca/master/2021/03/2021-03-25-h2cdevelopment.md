Dear Support,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice,  
the content was hacked from a private repository, the owner is a freelance working for my company H2C development located in [private].
all this projects are private content with sensitive data. 

https://github.com/SuperDeveloper10/inbody-android  
https://github.com/SuperDeveloper10/GymManager  
https://github.com/SuperDeveloper10/NFCBackend  

could you remove it ASAP otherwise it will compromise securtiy of my customers.  

The user need to delete the projects because it's stolen projects, with no autorization from
the proprita  
infringer: SuperDeveloper10  
stolen from private repository: [private]    

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law  I have taken fair use into consideration

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

best regards,
