**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the computer security incident response team for Italtel Brasil. I'm representing the organization Banco Digio which is facing a security risk.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This repository refers to a source code with information from my client that has been exposed (without proper authorization) - such as images such as the website's brand / logo. With the exposure of this repository, there is a risk that this material will be used improperly (someone can download and use it on a phishing site or the creation of a clone application for scams, for example).

 

The original works are my client's website where the logo images are located and so on. This is the site https://www.digio.com.br  , we can see that the files are the same as those in the repository.

 

The images can also be seen in the app's captures (authorized store:  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.digio   
https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lWBVoSewH2dx2NZPHB3oNHgwBvVb2MNDsw7cg0RpMgtiYidDy0JdNWYPL1j6IAGy2i0=w720-h310-rw) 

 

These icons and my client's logo are infringing my client's copyright.

 

This is their logo, which is used on the website and in the app:
