**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

A sub contractor employee published our source code on github earlier today. Including to the source code itself, there is a file with all the access keys to our google cloud project. This has clearly very problematic implications on us and customers data.

The subcontractor is signed on an NDA as well as MSA (Master Service Agreement) that clearly states confidentiality requirements.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The source code and access keys to a Google Firebase hosting environment and application was published on the sub contractor repository. An example of the data that infringing rights is:

https://github.com/unilimes/dtg/blob/a90f400d7900cbd1d987bac3d22cb83f4df39065/.env
and this is just one example.

There are three repositories that were published today that relate to work that was done, and paid, to us:

https://github.com/unilimes/dtg  
[invalid]  
[invalid]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All three repositories should be taken down, all are applications that are owned by me, where both the secret keys open to the whole world is problematic, but also the source code itself.

https://github.com/unilimes/dtg

[invalid]  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I did not see forks yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The repositories are exposing code that is not open source, the sub-contractor is signed on an NDA and MSA that touch the confidentiality aspects of the source code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove or block these repositories.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
