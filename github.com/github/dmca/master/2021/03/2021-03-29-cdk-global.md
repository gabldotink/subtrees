**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

I'm an Incident Response Analyst in the Global Security Organization of CDK Global with jurisdiction.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is code that belongs to CDK Global. In most cases, potentially active credentials are exposed in cleartext. While we are remediating risk internally, the code still needs to be removed, as it is our intellectual property and offers information regarding our secrets.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No - nothing is open source here.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

These files need to be removed. They are property of CDK Global, and these Github users are not currently employed here. Hiding or making these files private is not sufficient.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't have this information on hand. Someone from my team may have limited information on some individual(s). From my understanding, we've already reached out where possible to ask these to be taken down.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
