Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

I represent Galvanize Inc, owner of Hack Reactor, LLC whose protected intellectual property is being unlawfully posted by one of your users.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These works are not licensed under an open source license. It is Hack Reactor's proprietary information, and the user was informed of the same when he enrolled in our program.

Hack Reactor and Galvanize respectfully requests the removal of the infringing repositories.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We request that these repositories are made private or deleted in our outreach to this student. Either would be an acceptable solution. The material cannot be publicly accessible.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.
