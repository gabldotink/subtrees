My ex-employee uploaded Matteroom software code tp Github on July 27th 2018 and he lost his login to his account also his gmail mailbox used to register to this account also lost so that he won't have any access to that mailbox anymore. His account ID is n30curry. He submitted a request to remove his account on Jan 19th and got your response on Jan 26th notify him that password was sent to his registered mailbox which will not work. The situation is that the code is at https://github.com/n30curry/mp and it is a public repository. Our attorney is addressing this seriously and we'd like to urge Github to remove such repository asap.
