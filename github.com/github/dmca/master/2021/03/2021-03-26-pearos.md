I am a developer for pearOS, and in my team, I have a website designer, [private]. He made the website for the Pear Project team, and the design is unique. https://github.com/Itd-Os downloaded website from me. How did I find out? I have arc.io (a platform to share bandwidth and it shows me which page of the website is accessed and how many times(like a live visitor count), and I seen "https://itd-os.github.io/" in the website list, a website which I don t own, so I immediatly figured out, someone cloned my website, and renamed it's headers/title/content.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**
