**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I created the code with a friend

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/ThisIsNoahEvans/uuid

The code says that the site is made by Alles, and the commits show changed merged from alleshq, but there is no credit given to Alles and it appears as though this user wrote the code themselves.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ThisIsNoahEvans/uuid

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, it's under MIT, but the user has uploaded the repository under their account and it appears as though they own it, which is untrue.

The website is live at https://uuid.blue, where it links to the website for Alles (my brand)

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They should give give full credit to Alles (https://alles.cx) and a public apology, or alternatively just remove the repository and preferably the user account to avoid future copyright violations.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private] on Twitter, but they have blocked me to prevent me requesting them to take down the repository.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
