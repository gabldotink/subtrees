**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Hello.

My name is [private] and I am an employee of Invision Power Services, Inc.

A repository that your company is storing, is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

The repository in question is a copy our software, IPS Community Suite.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The unauthorized and infringing material can be found at:

https://github.com/colemclaren/moat.gg/tree/master/moat.gg/forums

It is a full copy of our IPS Community Suite version 4.3.5 as can be seen in this file (this is our versioning scheme):

https://github.com/colemclaren/moat.gg/blob/master/moat.gg/forums/applications/core/data/versions.json

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire folder must be removed:

https://github.com/colemclaren/moat.gg/tree/master/moat.gg/forums

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I believe this is also forked here:

https://github.com/vingard/moat.gg/tree/master/moat.gg/forums

That repository must also be removed. I do not know if there are other forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our software is NOT open source; it is a paid and licensed product.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The entire repository(s) must be removed; we do not allow the storage of our software anywhere other than the license holder's local computer, or on the server where the installed software resides.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have any contact information for the person in question. This repository was provided to us via our piracy reporting form.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
