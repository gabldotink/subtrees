**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The infringing files are our copyrighted work, as is evident from the copyright remarks ”Copyright (c) 2014, NTT DATA Getronics Corporation.”  
The infringer illegally took them out of development libraries and leaked to GitHub, together with copyrighted files of other companies including Mitsui Sumitomo Banking Corporation (SMBC), etc.

Japanese media have reported this leakage as follows:  
https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2102/01/news118.html  
https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2101/29/news107.html  
https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/news/18/09557/  
https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/news/18/09574/

The infringer has reportedly admitted the leakage in his twitter comments.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our files are parts of "B-FEP," a commercial software package we developed.  
Please see [private].

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have identified the following 189 forks and each of them contains files with our copyright remarks, "Copyright (c) 2014, NTT DATA Getronics Corporation.” Thus, we believe that the entire network is violating our copyright.
