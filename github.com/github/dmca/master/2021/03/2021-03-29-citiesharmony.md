**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

This is my repository: https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony  

The code is licensed under the MIT license, which can be reviewed in: https://github.com/boformer/CitiesHarmony/blob/master/LICENSE  

My name is listed in the license file: "Copyright (c) 2017 [private]"

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is the fork that infringes copyright: https://github.com/drok/Harmony-CitiesSkylines

The owner of the repository removed my license and relicensed the product under GNU GPL. This violates the MIT license of the original code, which must be included in the fork.
While some changes were made in the fork, it still contains a substantial amount of original code.

In some files that were relicensed, there are even comments stating:  
/* Borrowed from original CitiesHarmony mod by boformer - thank you! */  
right below the GPU GPL license header

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The majority of files in the repository https://github.com/drok/Harmony-CitiesSkylines violate the license shipped with the original code, because the license hasn't been redistributed (and in some cases conflicting license headers have been added)

MIT License.
