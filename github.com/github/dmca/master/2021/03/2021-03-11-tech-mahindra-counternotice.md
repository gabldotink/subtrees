We received a notice from GitHub that a takedown request was submitted by Tech Mahindra for the repo at https://github.com/onap/dcaegen2-platform-blueprints/. The only file cited in the notice is https://github.com/onap/dcaegen2-platform-blueprints/blob/50887a105d9a68c54e35b41df35616c64e8cf631/blueprints/k8s-ves-mapper.yaml; however, the request was to take down the entire repo.

Dispute the notice.
