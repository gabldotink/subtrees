**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

We are the computer security incident response team for Italtel Brasil. I'm representing the organization Gerdau S/A which is facing a security risk.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

This repository refers to a source code under development for my client that has been exposed (without proper authorization), as well as images such as the website's brand / logo. With the exposure of this repository, there is a risk that this material will be used improperly (someone can download and use it on a phishing site, for example).
The original works are my client's website where the logo images are located and so on. This is the site https://www2.gerdau.com.br/, we can see that the files are the same as those in the repository.

Those icons and my clients logo are infringing my client's copyright. 

This is they logo:
