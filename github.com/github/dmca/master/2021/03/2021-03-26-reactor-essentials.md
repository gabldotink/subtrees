**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the creator of the "Essentials" (also known as "Reactor-Essentials") library licensed under LGPL v3.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A library with some APIs and tools to make mod development for Among Us faster. https://github.com/DorCoMaNdO/Reactor-Essentials

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/slushiegoose/Town-Of-Us/releases/tag/v1.1.0  
https://github.com/slushiegoose/Town-Of-Us/releases/download/v1.1.0/TownOfUs-v1.1.0-2020.12.9s.zip  
https://github.com/slushiegoose/Town-Of-Us/releases/download/v1.1.0/TownOfUs-v1.1.0-2021.3.5s.zip

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, this mostly concerns the redistribution of a modified copy of the library, the source of which was not provided, nor were the changes documented anywhere.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

LGPL v3, the files inside the release archives are distributed under multiple licenses (files for which are not provided), but they're all open source, the main source of the "Town-Of-Us" repo is also not being kept up to date with the provided releases, while the files of it are distributed as GPL v3.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

A fork of my Reactor-Essentials repo with all the changes made to it applied and documented.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
