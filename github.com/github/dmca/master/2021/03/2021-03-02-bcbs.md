**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] from the Security Operations Center at Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of NJ. One of our threat intelligence services recently identified Horizon proprietary code that has been posted to Github over the last couple of years. I've reviewed each of the below URL's and determined that they were uploaded by past contractors from our organization. Leveraging Github as a code repository has never been allowed by company policy and upon inspection you will see that this is all code specifically written for Horizon BCBSNJ.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This takedown request includes source code from our public facing portal pages, some api schema mappings, and some sensitive username and passwords for our dev environment.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, other forks have been inspected.

na

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since this is all work produced by past employees or contractors specifically for Horizon BCBS of NJ we ask for a complete takedown.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have contact information as these were contractors that worked for us several years ago.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
