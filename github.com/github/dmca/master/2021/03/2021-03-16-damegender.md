**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the author of a text that has been added to a technical manual without my consent.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The author of this manual: https://github.com/davidam/damegender asked me to provide a prologue for it. I initially agreed and sent him a 3-paragraph text on good faith. Upon learning more about the nature of his interests on me I removed the consent for my prologue to appear in his manual and I repeatedly asked him per email to delete my name and my text from his manual. He refused and started a still ongoing email harassment campaign against me, while at the same time listing me as co-author of his manual elsewhere (Google Scholar, etc).

I do not consent for my material or my name to be included in the manual and, as owner of its copyright, I request that github removes it from the repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The prologue and my name as author, as well as my email contact details.

This is the commit that introduced the prologue:   
https://github.com/davidam/damegender/commit/c75823d9c5d808dba8d739a3c460344d47d5e93e#diff-36bde66f289a35683683b041c6d8f418a5f36607b547da25d00ad55891e80b88

The source for the prologue is in file:  
- https://github.com/davidam/damegender/blob/master/manual/damegender.texi

Other derivative files that contain my name and the text should also be amended:  
- https://github.com/davidam/damegender/blob/master/manual/damegender.pdf  
- https://github.com/davidam/damegender/blob/master/manual/damegender.pot  
- https://github.com/davidam/damegender/blob/master/manual/damegender.es.po

The same applies not only to "master" but also to branches "dev" and "packaging" of the repository.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I believe that repository https://github.com/davidam/damegender is the only one containing the copyright infringement.
There exist 3 forks but they have not been synced with the original repository since before the addition of the copyrighted material.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

I have not given any permission for my text to be licensed under any license, as I don't consent to its publication in any form.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be to completely remove my name as author of the prologue in the manual as well as my email address and remove the content of the prologue from the manual.

Making the repository private is not a satisfactory option, since the author is planning to publish the manual elsewhere carrying my name on it.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

These are the contact details that I am aware of:

Name: [private]  
Email addresses: [private] / [private]  
Website: [private]  
Twitter: [private]  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

You can contact me on the phone in the number [private].

Please don't share this information with the alleged infringer!

**Please type your full legal name below to sign this request.**
