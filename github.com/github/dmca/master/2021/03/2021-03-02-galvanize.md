**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I represent Galvanize Inc, owner of Hack Reactor, LLC whose protected intellectual property is being unlawfully posted by one of your users.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Hack Reactor operates an immersive Javascript coding school, where we use our proprietary curriculum to help train stellar engineers. GitHub handle Lxlo182 has willfully posted our entire curriculum across a series of repositories on GitHub.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Lxlo182/galvanize_activities

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Upon a reasonable search, I was unable to locate any "forks" of the infringing materials.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These works are not licensed under an open source license. It is Hack Reactor's proprietary information, and the user was informed of the same when he enrolled in our program.
Hack Reactor and Galvanize respectfully requests the removal of the infringing repositories.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We requested that these repositories are made private or deleted in our outreach to this student. Either would be an acceptable solution. The material cannot be publicly accessible.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
