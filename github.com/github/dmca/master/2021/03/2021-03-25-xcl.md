Hello Dear Github,  
I have created a Repository called [private] in [private] about 3 years ago. which contained creator, contents and domain name ([private]) are all owned by me. Later found that before I turn the repository into a private repository. the user named P79N6A completely forked my entire Repository, and it still exists.  
The following is Github's URL and screenshots about our forked Repository:  
https://github.com/P79N6A/xcl  


Since xcl contains the company's sensitive information. so I hope Githup as soon as possible to help me completely remove P79N6A/xcl and thank you very much.  
The following is my contact information:  
My e-mail Address: [private]
