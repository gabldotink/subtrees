It has come to our attention that a Project containing copyrighted content of our Project company which was Published on GitHub 21 days ago on Senior-dev-523 account with the title of Online-Airline-Platform https://github.com/Senior-dev-523/Online-Airline-Platform  is infringing our copyright right.

We have tried to contact the account owner but due to lack of contact details we were unable to do so.

Since, the project hosted on https://github.com/Senior-dev-523/Online-Airline-Platform  account is the identical version of a copyrighted project, which exposes our organization’s proprietary data, we request GitHub to get this project removed from Senior-dev-523’s account permanently from GitHub without leaving any trail or back up.

Given the criticality of the matter, we urge you to take this request forward expeditiously and would require an immediate action from your side to take down the files permanently without leaving any trail or back-up in the GITHUB systems.

Folders Name: adminfront, backend, database, frontend, white-label and all containing files in al of mentioned Folders

Line Number: Entire Project needs to be taken down as it is identic copy of an copyright infringing project

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This is itself a forked project.
