Dear Sir/Madam,

Sub: Take down of content illegally made available in your mobile application.

We act on behalf of our Clients, Star India Pvt. Ltd. and Novi Digital Entertainment Private Limited having their registered office at Star House, Urmi Estate, 95, Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel (W), Mumbai- 400013. We are under instructions to address you as under:

Our Client, Star India Pvt. Ltd. is amongst India's most diverse media companies. It owns and operates various entertainment channels, including the popular channels Star Plus, Star Jalsha, Channel V, Life OK, etc. (hereinafter "STAR Channels"), which are statutorily licensed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Consequently, the exclusive right to broadcast, re-broadcast, transmit and communicate to the public the STAR Channels and the content broadcast therein vests in Our Client.

It is also brought to your notice that Our Client, Star India has exclusive rights to broadcast, telecast and/or communicate to the public, content aired on STAR Channels on the digital platform, "Hotstar". No other entity can, without authorization from Our Clients, upload, stream, make available for download, broadcast and/or communicate to the public, content that is aired on the STAR Channels, in any manner whatsoever, (live, delayed, repeat etc.) through any transmission platform including the internet for viewing on various devices such as computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablet computers, etc.

STAR India is the exclusive owner of the channels in question (listed below). In addition, STAR India is also the exclusive owner of several trademarks connected with the channels owned by them.

We have come across that the pirate Application “Oreo TV” is illegally using the below mentioned websites to provide the copyright content (Live TV Channels & VOD Content) illegally.

 

Oreo Tv, a rogue standalone pirate application, has plagued the M&E industry especially the OTT platforms with free content of over 3000 Indian and International TV channels, movies, TV shows, Sports, web-series (VOD content) etc. It is gaining popularity due to the content availability from all the popular OTT apps like Hotstar, JioTV, Airtel TV, SonyLiv, Voot18 and Zee5. The application is available on Android devices via 3rd party application channels. However, it’s unavailable on any official platforms such as Google Play Store, i-Tunes etc. as it is a rogue pirate app.


We have come across the Oreo TV is using the API through the website "raw.githubusercontent.com" which further fuels the pirate and provides copyright content by unauthorized means.

The reported website is providing API through which the pirated app named  'Oreo TV'  is functioning and using Star Channels without any authorization which needs to be actioned at the earliest to avoid losses to our client.
