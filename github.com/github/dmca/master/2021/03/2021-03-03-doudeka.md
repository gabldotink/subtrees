**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

Duodeka has created these software applications for its clients.  
The rights belong to Duodeka and her clients.  
[private], a former disgruntled employee, has published all repos he has been in touch with in our company, but has no right (signed away in his employment contract).
95%+ of the code of all repositories is not written by Noud.

Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.

Stolen proprietary code created for our customers (this is a literal copy of our (customers') code):

recruitingfriends.com  
app.showfigures.nl  
hallolex.nl  
charterwatch.net  
backoffice.mrwinston.nl  
pos.mrwinston.nl / waiter.mrwinston.nl  
app.notulensoftware.nl  
replan.duodeka.com  

GraphQL boilerplate (incl. schema-converter) is our internal boilerplate which contains a lot of proprietary code, models and intellectual property.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

None, as of yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Open sources packages have been used in the development of these platforms, but the customer code is definitely NOT open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal: this code must be removed from public access as soon as possible.

[private] was contractually obliged to remove all of these repositories when he left our employ. Not doing so leaves him liable for criminal and civil charges, which we will pursue.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
