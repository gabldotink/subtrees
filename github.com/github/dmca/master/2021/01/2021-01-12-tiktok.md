**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is source code for the TikTok Android app. Github user [private] appears to claim to have reverse engineered the app. We submitted a DMCA notification 
to GitHub previously, resulting in a takedown. GitHub subsequently notified us that the user still had forks posted. These forks are listed below.  

Known forks:

https://github.com/funkygao/tiktok_source  
https://github.com/uni7corn/tiktok_source  
https://github.com/nielev/tiktok_source  
https://github.com/landryshuai/tiktok_source  
[private]  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files should be taken down. Further, as suggested in prior correspondence with GitHub, we request disabling the entire network because - based on the representative number of forks we have reviewed - we believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.Known forks:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. Listed above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

As discussed above, removal of known forks and disabling the entire network.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

See fork links for usernames. Original alleged infringer is [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
