**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the partial copyright holder as I authored the original code of a derivative work published in the infringing repository. The infringing code is a derivative work of my unpublished code, and I have never given my consent to the repository's owner for this code to be published, either in its original form or as a derived work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Between 2008 and 2009 I wrote a program named AntOrient for the personal use of a collaborator, who then extended it to add more functionality. The code is a GUI (graphical user interface) designed to load specific binary data files of which I developed the format, as well as image and CSV files, with the purpose of allowing the user to do manual measurements based on the loaded data and to write them back to a text file for further processing.

The original code is unpublished, and I only authorized the person who extended it (who is not the owner of this repository, nor of any of the forks) to publish it online. The code of the main program (mainwin.cpp) published on the infringing repository is constituted at around 47% of code I wrote: this is much more than what would be acceptable under the "fair use" doctrine.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[private]  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Fork of the infringing file:  
https://github.com/nathaliestroeymeyt/anttrackingUNIL/blob/master/Antorient/mainwin.cpp

Fork containing the infringing file:  
https://github.com/matthiasruegg/anttrackingUNIL/blob/master/Antorient.zip

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

My original work has not currently been licensed under any open source license. The publication of the modified code by the repository's owner under a GPLv3 license is problematic by itself as it tacitly implies that the original code has been open sourced, which is not the case.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Completely removing the AntOrient directory from the repository. Making the repository private would also be acceptable. Note that I already contacted the owner of the infringing repository asking for the deletion of the AntOrient.zip file, however [private] only unzipped it to present it in a more professional way and added my name in the source code. I contacted [private] again to ask for the removal, but didn't receive any answer.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes: [private] ([private])

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
