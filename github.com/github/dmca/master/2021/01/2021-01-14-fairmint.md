**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private], I am the [private] and [private] of Fairmint (https://fairmint.co) and we use github private repositories for all our software developments. All our repositories (public and private) are at https://github.com/fairmint

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It seems that a developer that contracted with us (we could not identify his identity behind his username) has publicly published copyrighted private software code without our authorization in the following repositories:  
https://github.com/goldenstar07/React-fairmint
https://github.com/goldenstar07/React-fairmint-app

these are copies from our private repositories:  
[private]  
[private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

These 2 repositories:  
https://github.com/goldenstar07/React-fairmint  
https://github.com/goldenstar07/React-fairmint-app  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I could not see any fork

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No our code is not under an open source license (at least not the code from those 2 repositories).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Full removal is the only acceptable solution, including all remaining copies the user probably has in its possession. No the repository cannot be made private. The person stole our code purely and simply.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. We haven't been able to identify him but, given the time of the copy, it narrows down the possibilities a lot and we have strong of who he could possibly be.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
