Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Hello,

I am [private] at Clear Link Technologies, LLC ("Clearlink"). I am reaching out because one of our prior developers, [private], used some of the code he created for Clearlink or our partners to post on his public GitHub Profile ([private]). I am requesting that this code, which Clearlink or our partners owned as [private] created it during the scope of his employment, be removed from his public profile.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate to the best of my ability and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The code posted online is for the following Clearlink owned or operated websites:

https://www.attexperts.com/  
https://www.attsavings.com/  
https://www.directvplans.com/  
https://www.usdirect.com/

The code links entitled: Business.Frontier, Dish2U, frontier-internet-service, getsafeco, vivr, and west.frontier are also all code that he developed for Clearlink or our partners during the scope of his employment

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[private] profile is at [private]

The code that Clearlnk is requesting be removed is:

attexperts: https://github.com/ericmcafee/attexperts  
attsavings: https://github.com/ericmcafee/attsavings  
business.frontier: https://github.com/ericmcafee/business.frontier  
directvplans: https://github.com/ericmcafee/directvplans  
dish2u: https://github.com/ericmcafee/dish2u  
frontier-internet-service: https://github.com/ericmcafee/frontier-internet-service  
getsafeco: https://github.com/ericmcafee/getsafeco  
usdirect: https://github.com/ericmcafee/usdirect  
vivr: https://github.com/ericmcafee/vivr  
west.frontier: https://github.com/ericmcafee/west.frontier

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not aware of any forks relating to the infringing files.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

To the best of my knowledge, the work is not licensed under an open-source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since [private] is no longer an employee of Clear Link Technologies, LLC, our preference is for all Clearlink or Clearlink partner-owned code to be removed from his public profile.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I only have an address that is several years old:
