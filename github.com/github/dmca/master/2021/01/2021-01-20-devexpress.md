**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of Enterprise Services at Developer Express Inc ("DevExpress"). DevExpress owns the intellectual property, trademark, and copyrights on all of its software development products.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

DevExpress is a software developer tools vendor - our products are available commercially at https://www.devexpress.com/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/beuvelet/DevSysteme.FrameWorks

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/codacy-badger/DevSysteme.FrameWorks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

DevExpress provides sources for some of its products as part of a commercial licensing scheme. The sources are provided to commercial customers in lieu of source code escrow and to serve as a reference tool for product troubleshooting. DevExpress software in question here is not open source and the sources for version 18.2 of the product have been reverse-engineered through decompilation, and illegally published in the aforementioned repositories.

This is verifiable via the presence of the following file (https://github.com/codacy-badger/DevSysteme.FrameWorks/blob/DevSysteme.FrameWorks/DevExpress.Data.v18.2.sln) as well the decompiler reference comment on line 3 of the following file (https://github.com/beuvelet/DevSysteme.FrameWorks/blob/DevSysteme.FrameWorks/DevSysteme.Data.v1.0.csproj).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories and their contents need to be removed, immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
