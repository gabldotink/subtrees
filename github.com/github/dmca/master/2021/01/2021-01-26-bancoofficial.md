**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repository available on the URL https://github.com/rphlfc/BancoOriginal is copying Banco Original`s official app without authorization from the company. The official app is available on the Play Store on https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.original.bank. We can see the similarity from screens from the read me archive on the reported repository. The used of official code from the app can lead to non-authorized copies, fake aps and modified versions that may harm users who may think they are accessing official app and content.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Total removal of the repository.
