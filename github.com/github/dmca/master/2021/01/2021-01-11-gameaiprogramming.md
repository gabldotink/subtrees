**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the original author and copyright owner of the material. My name ([private]) is also present in several files.  
The projects reported are part of the "Game AI Programming" module at Goldsmiths, University of London.  
I believe the student has posted the material in good faith, however without having the rights to do so.  
This is also causing several issues, since the material is currently being plagiarised by several other students.  
Under normal circumstances, I would have no issues with students posting college-related files online (even when they do not necessarily have copyright). But because of the disruption this is currently causing to the College, I am forced to issue a takedown notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The material comes from the "Game AI Programming" module that I currently teach at Goldsmiths, University of London.  
It is accessible for students only through this link: [private]  
The link is unfortunately non accessible outside Goldsmiths.

However, you can check the google docs below, that shows the assignment and refer to the code.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

However, upon contacting the users, they have kindly removed it or made private.  
The ones I linked in the box above are the ones that I could not reach out to, or to which the users have not replied.

I will report any new ones, shall I found them.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the material is not under an open source license.  
Students were given access as part of their studies at Goldsmiths, University of London.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Yes, the repository can be made private.  
I wish no consequences to the users, who I believe acted in good faith.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I have contacted several students using their personal emails available in our records.  
The personal email of user ish2nv is [private] , according to the College records.

Due to time constraints, I was unable to reach out to all of the other ones individually.
