Yes, I am the copyright holder.

This person has somehow illegally obtained an older copy of the source code for my site https://legiit.com and has posted it here: https://github.com/poudelsakar1/Legiit/tree/e500c2a3ceaad9bfd5d8ad4a7a5e5b3e7de9d6f7

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is the source code for our site, a freelance marketplace, Legiit. https://legiit.com

This person has somehow obtained a copy of it and posted it on GitHub at this URL: https://github.com/poudelsakar1/Legiit/tree/e500c2a3ceaad9bfd5d8ad4a7a5e5b3e7de9d6f7

He even says on it "This is the freelance website..."

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Everything at this URL.... all files, databases and so on: https://github.com/poudelsakar1/Legiit/

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I don't know what a "fork" is.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. It is not open source at all. It is private code that has been illegally obtained without permission.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No. This entire thing needs to be removed at once and his account on GitHub terminated.

This is the only information I have: https://github.com/poudelsakar1/
