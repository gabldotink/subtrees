**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I wrote the code in question.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is code I wrote, you can see from the commits. It was originally on my GitHub but was deleted. I don't want it to be associated with me because it is being used to aid in the theft of Apple devices (for bypassing Activation Lock).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/kazro/iOS_Jailbreak_Tweaks/tree/af52c0b601d9ec8b2f893a7a024f3677e4980b34/Hactivate (because I don't want it visible in the commit history)

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is ostensibly licensed as open source under GPLv3. However, I don't have permission to license the file "etc/plutil4hactivate" (it's from [private], which has no license at all). So, the open source license is actually invalid, and the project should be considered closed source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove this folder or make the repo private.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
