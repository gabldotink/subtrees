Hi Github Copyright Team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Please see attachments and emails. I was the victim of fraud on [private]. This person ([private]) signed an NDA to obtain my code and then attempted to extort me and now they have shared my confidential code on Github and other places. Please take it down and take some sort of action against this person.

My copyrighted work which has been illegally shared: https://github.com/QuintonAskew/Self-Care-AZ

The infringer would have to take down all my confidential info from all platforms and be banned from Github, as they already have been from [private] for committing fraud.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Infringer's contact info:

Name: [private]  

Email: [private]  

Contact #: [private]  

Address: [private]   

My contact info:
