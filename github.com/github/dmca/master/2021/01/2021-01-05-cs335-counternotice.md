**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the creator and sole maintainer.  
This work was created during an assignment given at the University of Auckland. University policy dictates that I am the copyright owner.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ConnorMattson/UoA-Computer-Science-Info

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The complaining party is not the copyright holder or acting on behalf of the copyright owner - I am the copyright owner.

In the original claim, the complaining party described my content as:  
"Copyrighted university homework that includes substantial portions of material distributed privately at the University of Auckland, New Zealand."

The content in question was indeed created for an assignment (a form of assessable work). However, section 4.3 of the University of Auckland policy, Intellectual Property Created By Staff and Students Policy, states that:  
"The University agrees that students are to be the first owners of copyright in their theses, dissertations and other assessable work."
This makes me the copyright owner of the content under dispute.

The complaining party also asserts that my source code derives from sample code provided as part of course work.  
"The solutions posted on GitHub derive from sample code provided to the students as part of the course work."  
The sample code provided consisted of short, functional snippets. As such, regardless of whether or not my code is derived from it, the sample code is not copyrightable.

The complaining party asserts in their DMCA takedown request that they do not have my contact information:  
"Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.  
No, but these are ex-students."  
I am [private] at the University of Auckland and the complaining party is a member of staff at the same university. As a member of staff, the complaining party is able to request (or even find it themselves) my contact information. I have not been contacted by the complaining party in any manner other than through their takedown request.  
From the same University of Auckland policy referenced earlier, I also note the following (section 9.4):  
"The University acknowledges that disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Policy should as far as possible be settled without resort to litigation or other legal process. The University will consult with all interested parties as to how this may be achieved."  
I would like to remind the complaining party that a DMCA complaint is a serious legal allegation. Because there has been no other attempt to contact me, the submission of this DMCA complaint was a breach of university policy.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
