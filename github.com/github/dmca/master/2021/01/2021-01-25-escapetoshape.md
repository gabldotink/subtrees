**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I was hired by Escape to Shape LLC to build a web application for their travel business. I am the primary author of the code in question, however as per our agreement, Escape to Shape LLC is the copyright owner. I spoke with [private] at Escape to Shape when I discovered the source code on two Github repositiories and she authorized me to submit this request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original source code can be found in a private repository at :

[private]

And also in a private repository that I used before Escape to Shape got their own Github account:

[private]

This is a web application used by Escape to Shape to sell and manage their trips online. It is built on top of the Laravel PHP framework and uses other thrid party libraries listed in both the package.json and composer.json file. Any modifications to the code from the point of installing the Laravel framework are considered to be proprietary and were never authorized for use by anyone outside of Escape to Shape LLC.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The two repositories I have identified so far that should be removed are:

https://github.com/craig-simon/Travel-Web-App-Vue.js-Laravel-  
https://github.com/dev916/TravelApp--VueJS-Laravel

These two files contain API keys and need to be removed immediately if possible:

/config/ymlp.php  
/resources/views/calendar.blade.php

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There does not appear to be any forks of these two repositories

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not licensed for use by anyone other than Escape to Shape. The Laravel framework and other third party packages that appear in this repository have their own licenses.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be for the removal of the repositories. They can freely download the Laravel Framework and any third party packages used in the application and do whatever they want with it as per those repositories licenses. However, the majority of the code here is prioprietary and they have no right to it.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have their contact information as its not listed on their Github profiles.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
