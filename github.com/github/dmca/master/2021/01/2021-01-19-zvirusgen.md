They copied the source code of my repository. And claimed that it is coded by them when infact it was me who coded it.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This github user are free to edit or modify my work but it seems like they have copy pasted all the source code of my repository and then changed my name and put "Coded by AnonyminHack5".

I do not forbid them to edit, modify and even put their "Coded by AnonyminHack5" if and only if:

If have recoded it, edit it or upgrade it or add some features of it. (But they did not. Instead you just copied my work)

Maybe after doing the first one. You can as long as they also put credits. (But then again, they did not. They just changed: Coded By [private] into Coded by AnonyminHack5 )

This is the real repository I've created: https://github.com/ZechBron/zVirus-Gen

And this is their repository that was taken from me:
