**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The dispute says that GleamTech clearly uses the Works of PDFTron Systems Inc. and PDFTron Systems Inc. has a copy of GleamTech’s unlawful work to preserve as evidence but PDFTron Systems Inc. has not presented any real evidence. The software “DocumentUltimate” is in same category “Document Viewer” as PDFTron Systems Inc. and the dispute says that the software has similar class/object names, this does not mean that we are using their code in our product (for example many companies can use generic name DocumentViewer for a class in their code).

Please take a look at live demos of GleamTech DocumentViewer and PDFTron WebViewer, they do not even look similar and they are completely different products:  
https://demos.gleamtech.com/documentultimate/AspNetWebFormsCS/#DocumentViewer/Overview.aspx  
https://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/demo/

Also GleamTech DocumentViewer is a "ASP.NET DocumentViewer" and PDFTron WebViewer is a "JavaScript PDF Library".
