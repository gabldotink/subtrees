Hello dear Github:

 

I am [private]. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice.

Just now I found that the entire repository on Gitbub infringed my copyright. the repositoryâ€™s URL: https://github.com/pr0blems/ZCE.

I couldn't contact the infringer.

Since the repository contains the company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal data assets, so I hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove https://github.com/pr0blems/ZCE and thank you very much.

 

The following is my contact information:

Name: [private]  

Email: [private]  

Telephone: +[private]  
 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

Hoping for your response, and thanks again.
