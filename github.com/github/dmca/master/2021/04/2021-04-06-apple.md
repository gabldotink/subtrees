**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We represent Apple Inc. and issue this notice on its behalf.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed is Apple's Final Cut Pro software application (https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Most recent:  
https://github.com/AppleExpertDev/AppleReborn/blob/0a3a2ff440a9ba8fff1a5464d33ac6869241172f/swpkgs.html

The file appears to include infringing links in all of its history, and we thus ask that all related commits be removed as well:  
https://github.com/AppleExpertDev/AppleReborn/swpkgs.html

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/JynXd-tech/AppleReborn/swpkgs.html  
https://github.com/Loaterss/AppleReborn/swpkgs.html  
https://github.com/matttMP/AppleReborn/swpkgs.html

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The identified repositories and the swpkgs.html are GitHub IO pages that link to pirated software, including Apple's copyrighted Final Cut Pro software application, which is the basis for this specific notice. At a minimum, we ask these infringing links be removed. However, we note that the entire repository infringes Apple's IP rights, including the use of "Apple".

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

N/A

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
