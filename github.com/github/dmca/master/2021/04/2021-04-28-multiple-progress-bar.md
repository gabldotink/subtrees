**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the full and sole owner of this code repository. The original idea belonged to me, and the repository was created from scratch and [private], as evidenced by the history of commits under the authorship of [private] work and personal accounts:  
- personal account: https://github.com/GeniusRUS  
- working account: [private]

I deliberately chose the Apache 2.0 license as the most suitable for the possible use of my code by other people and would like the rules described in it to be observed. Now I am deeply convinced that my code was stolen and presented by someone else's authorship. Proof of this can be seen in commits where [private] changes the package name to his own name. And also deliberately changes the license without attribution

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am [private] of the original library. Development history visible in commits since 2019  
https://github.com/GeniusRUS/MultiProgressBar

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/salihselimsekerci/MultipleProgressBar

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/TrendingTechnology/MultipleProgressBar

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, Apache 2.0 license is used. And [private], in addition to stealing the code itself, also changed the license to a freer one, MIT. My original authorship was also not indicated anywhere, as required by the Apache 2.0 license I indicated

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I see the only way out - deleting the repository with the stolen code. If [private] wants to use my code, then let him fork my repository with attribution and freely modify, distribute it, as indicated in the license I have chosen. I am deeply convinced that this was done deliberately in order to appropriate the authorship of this code for himself and, thus, improve his GitHub profile and, thus, deceive his colleagues and potential employers with other people's merits

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Email: [private]  
Website: [private]  
Twitter: [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
