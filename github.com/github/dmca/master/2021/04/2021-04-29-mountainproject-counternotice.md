The sender of the takedown notice, Adventure Projects, is mistaken as to their ownership of the materials. The materials were contributed by users of the Mountain Project website. Adventure Projects does not hold any copyright, or an exclusive license, in any of the materials, nor in their selection and arrangement. No user of Mountain Project has complained about the use of their materials in the repository. My use of the materials is also a fair use.

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
