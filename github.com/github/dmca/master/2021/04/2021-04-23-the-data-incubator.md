I work for the company and helped create content which has been infringed. The Data Incubator operates a course on behalf of WorldQuant University (https://wqu.org/programs/data-science), including developing interactive course content, creating videos, running an online learning platform, and handling admissions (https://wqu-apply.thedataincubator.com/, private repository: [private])
