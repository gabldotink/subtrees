**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm fully authorized to act on behalf of Beijing SenseTime Technology Development Co., Ltd., the copyright owner of the work described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

SenseTime owns a registered copyright named “Embedded Face SDK Software [or simply: embFaceSDK] V3.0.0” relating to its license products named “SZMobileFaceSDK” and/or “SZMobileImageSDK” in China, and the copyright registration number is [private]. Source codes and all information of the above registered copyright, which are all developed by SenseTime itself and should be proprietary and confidential, are released by certain third parties (Github users) and posted into repositories below in Github without SenseTime’s authorization. We affirm that the entire repositories below are infringing SenseTime’s copyright as these repositories below are all source codes of SenseTime products and are exactly the same with that of SenseTime’s registered copyright. Thus, it is very possible that SenseTime’s products codes are leaked and are posted by certain third parties into Github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We now resend an entire DMCA takedown notice to takedown entire infringing repositories according to your request to make clear that all forks, if any, are not needed to be taken down.
We assert that the entire repositories below are infringing SenseTime’s registered copyright and hope them to be removed. URLs of each of the repositories are:
