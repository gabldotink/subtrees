Recently we noticed that one of Kion Group projects stored at [private] was public in accident, therefore, we disabled it immediately in our organization. However, after double checking on the entire GitHub to make sure there is no other repo is public, we found this repo was forked by another user at https://github.com/tayduivn/LindeTruck-Mobile-DMSApp. And because our original repo has been disabled, this forked repo becomes the new parent repo, but all 6 contributors of this new parent repo were members of [private] organization, including me ([private]) the creator and owner of the original repo.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repo at https://github.com/tayduivn/LindeTruck-Mobile-DMSApp.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There is no other fork repo, just the new parent repo after our original one is disabled.

No, the work is not open sourced and belongs to Kion Group solely.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The entire repo should be taken down and deleted because the work belongs to Kion Group solely and cannot have it without their permission.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. We tried to contact the user but cannot find any contact information on his/her GitHub home page.
