Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work for the company and helped create content which has been infringed. The Data Incubator operates a course on behalf of WorldQuant University (https://wqu.org/programs/data-science), including developing interactive course content, creating videos, running an online learning platform, and handling admissions (https://wqu-apply.thedataincubator.com/, private repository: [private])

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our Jupyter notebooks have a copyright statement at the very end. You can see it here, for example: https://github.com/dwihdyn/wqu-ds-unit2/blob/master/wqu-ds-2/datacourse/machine-learning/ML_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb

Our organization, The Data Incubator, use GitHub to host our work (in a private repo) for development purposes. You can see our repo here:

This particular work is for our "Unit II" Data Science module

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, and those individual links are listed above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it is not licensed to be open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Distribution of the files online by entities other than The Data Incubator and WorldQuant University is forbidden. Even a private repo could be used to distribute these files in ways which violate our copyright. The repo should be removed.
