I posted a repository "[private]" and I inadvertently posted data that belong to a third party. The third party threatened to sue me if the data is not removed.  
There are 4 users who forked the repository. I was able to contact one, and he agreed to remove the repo.  
I contacted 2 others and waiting for their replies.  
One of the users does not have a contact email, and all of this repositories are forked, so there is no way to contact him/her.  
The fork is: https://github.com/medical-projects/Attention-Enriched-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation  
Could you please ask the user "medical-projects" to delete the forked repository listed above.  
Thank you,

As I mentioned, the copyrighted work is about a dataset of breast ultrasound images. The owners of the dataset gave me access, but I didn't realize that they prohibited redistribution of the dataset.
