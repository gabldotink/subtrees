Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is not licensed under an open source license. The assets are sold under the terms of the Asset Store EULA: https://unity3d.com/es/legal/as_terms. I am the copyright holder of this asset, as stated in section 9 (Copyright) of the EULA. The infringing URLs provided below are redistributing the asset in its entirety, which is explicitly forbidden by the EULA (specifically, sections 2.2.1 and 3.8).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories need to be removed or, alternatively, made private.
