**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a publisher of modifications to the World of Warcraft addon "Altoholic". I was granted a license to publish these modifications by the original author in February 2020, and the license did not contain any provisions to allow the original author to revoke that license. This code continues to use the codebase as at February 2020 and exists based on changes I have made since, respecting the original license conditions.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The code that is currently published does not contain any changes that violate Blizzards UI Development Policy. Even if it did, a breach of Blizzards UI Development Policy does not form a Terms of Service violation anyway. You can read through the entire Blizzards Terms of Service Agreement and you will not find any reference to the UI Development Policy in it. As there is no breach to Blizzards UI Development Policy, the original license this code was granted under is still valid and cannot be revoked.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
