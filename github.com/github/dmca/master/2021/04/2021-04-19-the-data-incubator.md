Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work for the company and helped create content which has been infringed. The Data Incubator operates a course on behalf of WorldQuant University (https://wqu.org/programs/data-science), including developing interactive course content, creating videos, running an online learning platform, and handling admissions (https://wqu-apply.thedataincubator.com/, private repository: [private])

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our Jupyter notebooks have a copyright statement at the very end. You can see it here, for example: [invalid]

Our organization, The Data Incubator, use GitHub to host our work (in a private repo) for development purposes. You can see our repo here:  
[private]

These infringements are for our "Unit I" Data Science module
