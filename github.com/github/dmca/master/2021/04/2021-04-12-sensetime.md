SenseTime owns a registered copyright named “Liveness Detection Software V2.0 of Sensetime’s Intelligent Identity Verification Platform” relating to its license product named “senseid_ocr” in China, and the copyright registration number is [private]. Source codes and all information of the above registered copyright, which are all developed by SenseTime itself and should be proprietary and confidential, are released by a certain third party (Github user: tnrn) and posted into repositories below in Github without SenseTime’s authorization. We affirm that the entire repository below is infringing SenseTime’s copyright as the repository below contains all source codes of SenseTime products which are exactly the same with that of SenseTime’s registered copyright. Thus, it is very possible that SenseTime’s products codes are leaked and are posted by certain third parties into Github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We assert that the entire repositories below are infringing SenseTime’s registered copyright and hope them to be removed. URLs of each of the repositories are:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched for forks of the allegedly infringing repositories, there is 1 fork found up to now, but please ignore it as no infringing content is found up to now based on our investigation.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These source codes are not licensed under any open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please help us remove all the above repositories which infringe SenseTime's rights by reproducing substantial portions of SenseTime's internal and proprietary source codes. Specifically, enter “sensetime” in the search box in the above URLs of the repositories and press Enter, you’ll find the links to the encrypted source codes package with the corresponding license product “senseid_ocr” owned by Sensetime.

We don’t have any contact information about these Github users, and we hope you can provide to us if you do.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
