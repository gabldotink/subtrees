Correspondence to the copyright owner’s work:

DocumentUltimate is a substantial copy of the code and files from the copyright owner’s work. See the representative analysis provided in Exhibit A providing side by side comparison of the hex code for arbitrarily selected specific files of the copyright work (WebViewer) as compared to the corresponding file of the infringing work (DocumentUltimate). In Exhibit A substantially only the term PDFNet (copyright owner’s product nomenclature) has been substituted in the infringing copy along with renaming variables. The balance is a substantial reproduction of the code of the copyright owner’s work. This is an example file only. Similar comparisons can be made throughout the infringing product.
