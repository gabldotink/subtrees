**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a student at the University of Waterloo and this code was part of an assignment. According to our policy, the student and the professor are co-owners of the code.

The following link describes this relationship, just for more information: https://uwaterloo.ca/math/code-sharing-policy

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I had previously posted some code to my repository, but I accidentally left it public which allowed an individual to steal the code and have it in their own repository. As stated, this code was a part of one of the assignments at my university, and as such I did not have permission to post it.

You can see in this individual's repository: https://github.com/CodingWithAmit-07/Custom-C-Compiler  
Their code is exactly like my own: [private]  
Furthermore, you can see by these graphs that I posted the code first: https://github.com/CodingWithAmit-07/Custom-C-Compiler/graphs/contributors

To be more specific, I would like all of the files in the repository to be taken down because it is all a part of the assignment. This includes a README, wlp4.lr1, wlp4gen.cc, and wlp4parse.cc. These were part of our final assignment to write a custom C compiler. The course itself is called CS241: Foundations of Sequential Programs, and I had taken this course [private], so [private] this code around July, and I posted it to Github after the course had ended, as you can see in the graph. I can also provide a proof of enrolment as soon as requested if it is required.

Furthermore, if this is not taken down, if a student taking the course at the university copies the code from this repository, I could be held accountable and my mark in the course may be affected.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/CodingWithAmit-07/Custom-C-Compiler

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I do not see any forks in either of our repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They must take down all of the files in the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
