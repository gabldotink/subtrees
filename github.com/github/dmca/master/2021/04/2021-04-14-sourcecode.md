We are the development company supporting and developing on this client's account and on their behalf, we also own the original codebase repository that the website is based off of.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We were notified that the Google API key we were used was located in this repository:

https://github.com/thabonyatlo/KlassyTiara

It looks like they scraped our oui.jeandousset.com website.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository: https://github.com/thabonyatlo/KlassyTiara

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We would be notified by Google if there were any further ones. Since this is a website scrape there is no forked repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is copyrighted to [private], a Jeweler in California.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal is the only solution, this is our client's website and it is NOT open source for anyone to grab.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
