This is a notice in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA) requesting that you immediately cease to provide access to copyrighted material. I wish to report an instance of Copyright Infringement, whereby the infringing material appears on a website for which you are the host.
 
1. The infringing material, which I contend belongs to our client, Iberdrola, is located in the following URL:

https://github.com/ororkersp/energyangular/blob/f70cff60b26c06311c117182fe14091e178b9467/src/main/java/com/iberdrola/dtp/web/rest/UserResource.java

2. The repository contains the source code of an application owned by Iberdrola, as can be seen in the name of the packages (com.iberdrola.dtp.xxx)

As part of this source code, the developers' own comments are included, both in this specific file and in others within the repository -> energyangular / src / main / java / com / Iberdrola ...

These comments provide information about the internal workings of the application, which could allow a threat actor to find out how to evade security measures and controls implemented as part of the app, thus attacking real clients of the app in a real-world scenario.

Additionally, the public disposition of this code implies the possibility, for any malicious user who wishes, to create alternative copies of the legitimate application for unknown purposes such as the collection of personal information from users, the distribution of malware, etc.

In other words, proprietary code is being shared through an unofficial channel.

3. My contact information is:
 
Name: Telefonica España  
Mailing address: Ronda de la Comunicación s/n, 28050 Madrid, Spain Telephone number: [private] ([private]) E-mail address: [private]
 
4. I have a good faith belief that the use of the described material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by operation of law.
 
5. The information in this notice is accurate, and I am authorized to act on behalf of our client Iberdrola, the copyright owner.
 
I declare under the perjury laws of the United States of America that this notification is true and correct.

Signed: [private]
