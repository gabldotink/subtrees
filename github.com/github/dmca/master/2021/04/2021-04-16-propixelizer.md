**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private], I am [private] of the asset, as even identified in the uploaded files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] a plugin for the Unity game engine called ProPixelizer, which can be found here:  
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/propixelizer-177877   
The files listed in the repository are as sold on the Unity store. The license forbids them from further distribution, even in modified form.

[private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files in https://github.com/capnjake/TDL_Game/tree/b05764fef34bc0103905a11fb9c63a4c5c3c6b06/Assets/ProPixelizer

TDL_Game/Assets/ProPixelizer/

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not searched forks - this is the responsibility of GitHub, who has infringed my copyright.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository should be made private. I don't mind this person hosting the files privately. What bothers me is that now I can just search 'ProPixelizer' in github and instantly get a free copy of an Asset [private] on the store.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private] is listed in the commit history

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

My mobile number is [private]
Email is much easier though - [private] is preferred.
