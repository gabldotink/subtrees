This source code was developed during the hackathon competition by my team and me. All pieces of code were developed only by us and weren't stolen or borrowed from the third part. The main idea of the whole app development was also created during the hackathon and with help only from the hackathon's mentors. Furthermore, we have never seen the swiss company 'Sportunity' and never wanted to copy their ideas or the source code.
