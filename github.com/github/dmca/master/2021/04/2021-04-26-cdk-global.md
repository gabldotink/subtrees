**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm an [private] in the Global Security Organization of CDK Global with jurisdiction.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is a follow up on discovered forks from our first [private], ID: [private]

This is also a follow up from [private], which is the same request, but supposedly didn't state this was our intellectual property...

https://github.com/ewin66/service needs a takedown notice because it contains real credentials (password has actually already been changed, but is still our secret) for our Vehicle Cloud FTP server. It also contains other credentials. There is code related to our product (DMS). This is intellectual property of CDK Global.

https://github.com/razeshbejjanki/test needs a takedown notice because It contains internal credentials for CDK ALM infrastructure and a bunch of other internal things such as LDAP credentials for DIS, oracle credentials for what might be the Connected Store database, an email auth key, and other things. This is all CDK infrastructure and intellectual property of CDK Global.

To reiterate, all files within both of these repositories are intellectual property of CDK Global.

These are forks from repositories that were successfully removed in our first ticket. I don't know what further information I need to provide. The previous follow up ticket stated the same information - how these repositories contain our property. "CDK", our products, and authentication mechanisms are displayed in the code in cleartext.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ewin66/service

https://github.com/razeshbejjanki/test

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No - each of these repositories are forks from our previous ticket discovered by Github support that we've investigated.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Not open source. Intellectual property of CDK Global.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

These contain sensitive information belonging to CDK Global and need to be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
