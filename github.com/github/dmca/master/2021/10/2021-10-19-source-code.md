**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The whole code in the repository was completely written by me and released publically on 9th September 2021.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This repository includes python code of a telegram bot and was published on Github on 9th September 2021.
https://github.com/subinps/VCPlayerBot.

The reporting Repository was created on  September 4. The repo created on september 4 was the main branch and he made an alpha branch on September 9, when I released my https://github.com/subinps/VCPlayerBot. And on September 12 he copied the whole code from my repository and committed (https://github.com/AsmSafone/VideoPlayerBot/commit/b0ff0116fd4e4b1a3b2d386680c5b4f2fd2450f6) to the alpha branch. This is where the infringement happened. You can compare the files of both the repositories at this point of time and you can find that what he changed was just some strings and added some emojis. And also he removed all the traces that the original code was written by me.

And further on whenever i push an update to my repository he changes the code in his repository also. He claims to the public that he is the real owner of the codes, and sometimes the public also may believe that he is the real owner , since the creation of that repo precedes mine. This is the reason that I want the repo to be taken down.

I tried to contact his through [invalid] and asked about the matter and on that date he made a commit which includes my name and repo in credit (https://github.com/AsmSafone/VideoPlayerBot/tree/alpha#credits) section of his repo.But  further he removed that and deleted that commit from commit history.



**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/AsmSafone/VideoPlayerBot/tree/alpha .
This one is an exact copy of my original work https://github.com/subinps/VCPlayerBot . The infringer just changed my name and replaced it with his own name.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are 241 forks for the repository and the people who forked may not be aware of the fact that the content is a stolen one. So let it be there, I would like to takedown the main repository that is alpha branch of https://github.com/AsmSafone/VideoPlayerBot/tree/alpha .

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes the whole project was licenced under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 . He replaced my name from the licence with his own name.

The LICENCE allows anyone to modify the code and use it. But the conditions of licence are not met by the infringer. The conditions include that the forked one should disclose the source and also should use the same LICENSE. He replaced the license and used it. And he changed all the traces of the original repo and made the public believe that the repo belongs to him.

He has not forked the repo; he just downloaded the whole code and uploaded after a slight immaterial modification. If it was a fork, it would be okay that it includes a credit to the original repository. If it was an import also, it includes the old commit history. But here what he did was just stealing the codes.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The alpha branch should be removed. I have already tried to contact him through [invalid] and also raised a github issue https://github.com/AsmSafone/VideoPlayerBot/issues/17 , but he refused to remove the alpha branch.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
