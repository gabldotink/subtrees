**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The repository should be reverted to the state before these unlawfully obtained commits were pushed otherwise the entire repository should be taken down.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks of this repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

While the source code is under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 only those elements to build the mail client are being publicly released in Executable Form under that license which would require the source code that went into it to be disclosed. As these stolen patches were obtained without authorization from a private repository not currently hosted on Github no argument over the validity of the patches can be made.

Additionally, the commits relate to a project in the repository that has never been officially released outside of private hands thus until it is the source code changes in question would remain under private copyright until such time an Executable Form was released.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

There are no other alternatives to resolving this infringement issue.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Github Account roytam1 but no issue tracker is enabled at the repository in question and all other points of communication are not available to me.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
