**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I am the original author and owner of the copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Code that [private] for the ESP32 microcontroller using the ESP-IDF in my repository:

Specifically these files have been copied without my consent and the header changed to reflect a new author:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/fn-code/esp-idf-hello-word/blob/master/include/TaskMessaging.h  
https://github.com/fn-code/esp-idf-hello-word/blob/master/include/gpio.h

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks which I object to.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

As stated in the issue I raised in the offending repository, here:  
https://github.com/fn-code/esp-idf-hello-word/issues/1

I would be content with the repository being deleted, then forked, so there is a traceable route back to my original work. Alternatively, I would be content with the URL to my repository being cited at the start of any file which uses my original work.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I only have their Github URL:  
https://github.com/fn-code

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
