**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I [private] for IHS Markit, a 14,000 employee firm (NYSE:INFO). We have discovered that some employees have posted code on GitHub against our corporate policy and I've been asked to get it taken down. The code was posted using GitHub personal accounts tied to [private] email addresses and some of it is sensitive. I am starting with a single request for 2 repos posted by a single user; if we find others, I'd like to know whether I can combine them into one big DMCA or need to do it at the repo or user level.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original code is hosted privately on internal servers. This particular code is related to the KYC application described here:https://ihsmarkit.com/products/kyc-services.html . It should be fairly clear from the repo contents (e.g. "kyc-app-heartbeat") and the presence of secrets (IHS Markit usernames and passwords) in files like https://github.com/ankitagupta0909/mkt-auto/blob/1a16a8523dfd88d966c7675836dc54873312fb71/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.history/16/008adcd58e7300171c7bcb955996dfa3 that this is not meant to be public code.

This is likely an innocent judgement error but the employee ([private]) is no longer employed here.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ankitagupta0909/mkt-auto (entire repo)

https://github.com/ankitagupta0909/mk-auto (entire repo)

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We don't. This is an ex-employee that we think posted this code as a convenience and not maliciously.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
