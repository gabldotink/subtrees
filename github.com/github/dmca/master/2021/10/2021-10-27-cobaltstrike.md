Cobalt Strike software

This includes (in the main repo below as well as the ones listed under forks), decompiled source code (Java) and/or cobaltstrike.jar (which is the jar file that contains the compiled classes) and/or other Cobalt Strike artifacts (specifically cobaltstrike.auth which is used to license the product and samples are often shared online to help bypass licensing).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/SuperDolby/Cobaltstrike_4.3_Source (as you can see in the repo's readme, it is Cobalt Strike source code and the entire repo needs to be taken down).

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Note that while these are not all forks of the repository above, they are all separate repositories that contain either decompiled Cobalt Strike Java source code and/or cobaltstrike.jar and/or other Cobalt Strike artifacts. I'm including these here as instructed in the note above, rather than submitting multiple takedown notices:

The following repositories contain cracked copies of Cobalt Strike and/or decompiled Cobalt Strike Java code. In each case, the entire repository violates our copyright and needs to be taken down:
