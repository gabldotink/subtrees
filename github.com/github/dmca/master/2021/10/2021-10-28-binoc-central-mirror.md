No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

There are no networked forks of this repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

While the source code is under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 only those elements to build the mail client are being publicly released in Executable Form under that license which would require the source code that went into it to be disclosed. As these stolen patches were obtained without authorization from a private repository not currently hosted on Github no argument over the validity of the patches can be made.

Additionally, the commits relate to a project in the repository that has never been officially released outside of private hands thus until it is the source code changes in question would remain under private copyright until such time an Executable Form was released.

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

n/a

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

There are no other alternatives to resolving this infringement issue.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
