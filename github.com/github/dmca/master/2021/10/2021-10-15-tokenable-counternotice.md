I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

I was contracted to create a mod for Minecraft. The agreement was that the mod would be made, and a jar file delivered. This was completed on August 3rd, 2021. The Client never specified that they would like to own the source code, and they did not properly read the entire agreement that they signed which states the following:

"All of my mods created here will be publicly posted on my Curseforge for all to download, and have their sourcecode posted publicly on my Github, unless you order premium and request it privately." The Client did not request the mod to be private.

Additionally, it was stated in a conversation during the creation that I would own the mod and the source code. The client did not protest and did not cancel the project. The client also commissioned additional projects after this conversation.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The complaining party is an ex-client who I cut ties with after a disagreement about a project. The project was canceled, and the money refunded. The complaining party then attacked me personally for my Nationality and work ethic on the Git repositories, and Curseforge pages, as well as PMs. I blocked them on all platforms, and I believe the complaining party is using DMCA to get at me the only way they can as well as get my personal contact info.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
