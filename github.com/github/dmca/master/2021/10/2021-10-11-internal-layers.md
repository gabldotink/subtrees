Two different layers from a private project are somehow on two different hackers github repository. Only found during search by symbol name in C/C++. The project has been private since inception and was not intended for public distribution. The project is originally hosted on https://github.com/ajkhoury -- link is https://github.com/ajkhoury/Internal.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The original project link is listed here: https://github.com/ajkhoury/Internal. You can check the dates and see it was never made public, and that the users infringing on the licenses have ripped them out of the headers.

The projects that should be taken down are listed below:

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Prior to today, I did not have 2FA, I've since enabled 2FA by SMS and will be resetting my password. The project owner has pulled my rights from this former project on my request because I'm unsure if my account or otherwise was compromised over the last 2 years. I had no reason to believe my account had been compromised.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Removing licenses and license notices from headers, publicly distributing without consent.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
