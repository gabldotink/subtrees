I am the original developer of that script and only me has the right to sell it or publish it for free.

https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-qb-casino-slots-machine-with-sounds/2978955 this my post inside fivem forum

this is my webstore that i sell the script on tebex

this is the original upload by me so customers can download it after the buy like fivem TOS said.
