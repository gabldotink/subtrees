A person has taken [private] compiled code and posted it on github with all user authorization removed in an attempt lower [private] profits

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original code is hosted on a private repo on github where few users have access, though discord [private] have granted a larger amount of people access to a compiled version of the software in exchange for money that [private] use to keep [private] server up and running. [private] haven't used any bytecode obfuscators until now for the reason that [private] didn't think the project would get big enough to the point where people start removing [private] auth and giving it out for free. The original repo is [private] and is a legitimate repo, the website for the project is http://hummusclient.info/. The repos that are infringing on [private] copyright even claim in the readme that they removed all api calls and the name of the repo itself is "HummusClientCracked". The next text field contains the repo and a fork of it where they are storing the files for download. [private] would appreciate it if you were to take the files since it's really starting to cut into [private] profits
