Good day,

It has been determined that several forked repositories identified by
"Male-Poon"[1a] on Github are currently using and publishing
branding[3][3a][3b] from our Pale Moon browser project ("the Work")[2]
without our authorization which constitutes copyrighted work in
accordance with Title 17 of the U.S. Code.

Details of infringement:  
I. Copyrighted branding materials: I have found the unauthorized use of
my work being used in almost all branches[5] of the forked Male-Poon
repositories [4], including but not limited to the Pale Moon logo
[4a] and wordmark [4b].  
[4], [4a] and [4b] infringe upon [3], with examples [3a], [3b]
(non-exhaustive)

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into
consideration.

Accordingly, I demand that you immediately remove the material and cease
any further all of my Work, including any other infringements, otherwise
you could be liable for statutory damages as high as $150,000 as set
forth in Section 504(c)(2).

If you do not cease the use of the aforementioned copyrighted material a
lawsuit will be commenced against you.

Furthermore, I demand that you immediately cease the use and
distribution of all infringing works derived from the Work, and all
copies of same, and that destroy such copies immediately and that you
desist from this or any other infringement of our rights in the future.
I ask that you take the appropriate action to remove any and all copies
of said material from these repositories that have my Work included in
order to satisfy my demand for removal or otherwise block public access
to said material.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,  
[private]
