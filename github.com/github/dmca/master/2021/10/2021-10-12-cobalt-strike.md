[private] for Cobalt Strike at HelpSystems LLC  
HelpSystems owns the Cobalt Strike brand and all related intellectual property

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Cobalt Strike software  
This includes (in the main repo below as well as the ones listed under forks), decompiled source code (Java) and/or cobaltstrike.jar (which is the jar file that contains the compiled classes) and/or other Cobalt Strike artifacts (specifically cobaltstrike.auth which is used to license the product and samples are often shared online to help bypass licensing). 

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/yeshuibo/CobaltstrikeSource (the entire repo contains decompile Java classes and the whole thing is infringing our copyright

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Note that while these are not all forks of the repository above, they are all separate repositories that contain either decompiled Cobalt Strike Java source code and/or cobaltstrike.jar and/or other Cobalt Strike artifacts. I'm including these here as instructed in the note above, rather than submitting multiple takedown notices:

The following repositories contain cracked copies of Cobalt Strike and/or decompiled Cobalt Strike Java code. In each case, the entire repository violates our copyright and needs to be taken down:

As far as I can see (as it’s in Chinese), the folder “%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7/cs4.2/cs4.2no” (the top folder in each repository, then “cs4.2/cs4.2no”) in the following repositories contains copyrighted material. Nothing else in the repository infringes out copyright and nothing else needs to be removed. As requested, for clarification, here is a list of all of the files in the “cs4.2no” folder that infringe our copyright and which need to be removed (note that, as mentioned, this is literally the entire contents of that folder):

.DS_Store, .cobaltstrike.beacon_keys, agscript, c2lint, cobaltstrike, cobaltstrike.auth, cobaltstrike.bat, cobaltstrike.jar, cobaltstrike.store, icon.jpg, license.pdf, peclone, readme.txt, teamserver, update, update.jar, third-party/README.winvnc.txt, third-party/winvnc.x64.dll, third-party/winvnc.x86.dll

All of the files above (the entire contents of the cs4.2no folder) need to be taken down. Nothing else in the rest of the repository needs to be removed. Just that folder and its contents.

The folders “client/opt/cobaltstrike” and “server/opt/cobaltstrike” in the following repositories contain copyrighted material. As requested, for clarification, here is a list of all of the files that infringe our copyright and which need to be removed:

server/opt/cobaltstrike/agscript, server/opt/cobaltstrike/c2lint, server/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike, server/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.auth, server/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.jar, server/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.store, server/opt/cobaltstrike/peclone, server/opt/cobaltstrike/start.sh, server/opt/cobaltstrike/teamserver, client/opt/cobaltstrike/agscript, client/opt/cobaltstrike/c2lint, client/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike, client/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.auth, client/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.jar, client/opt/cobaltstrike/cobaltstrike.store, client/opt/cobaltstrike/peclone, client/opt/cobaltstrike/start.sh, client/opt/cobaltstrike/teamserver, client/opt/cobaltstrike/third-party/README.winvnc.txt, client/opt/cobaltstrike/third-party/winvnc.x64.dll, client/opt/cobaltstrike/third-party/winvnc.x86.dll, client/opt/cobaltstrike/third-party/winvnc.x86.dll.bak, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/dist-pipe/artifact.cna, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/bypass-peek.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/bypass-pipe.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/bypass-readfile.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/bypass-template.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/injector.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/patch.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/patch.h, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkit/src-common/start_thread.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkitsrc-main/dllmain.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkitsrc-main/dllmain.def, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkitsrc-main/icon.ico, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkitsrc-main/main.c, client/opt/cobaltstrike/artifactkitsrc-main/svcmain.c

The rest of the repository in each case is unrelated to Cobalt Strike and does not need to be removed:

This repository contains a copy of the product (CobaltStrike_4.1.zip) in the folder below that needs to be removed. The rest of the repository appears to be unrelated:
https://github.com/rutelavida/esonhugh.github.io/tree/9b569ae29699e4b949c0158f1a237827a1fb7d68/back

These repositories contain Cobalt Strike licensing material (cobaltstrike.auth and authkey.pub) and a class used in the licensing process (AuthCrypto.class). They are obviously used to bypass licensing and the repositories need to be taken down:
https://github.com/badboycxcc/cobaltstrike4.3  
https://github.com/lnaphade/cobaltstrike4.3  

This repository contains Cobalt Strike licensing material (cobaltstrike.auth and authkey.pub) that are used to crack/bypass Cobalt Strike licensing. The rest of the repository doesn't appear to contain any other copyrighted material so just those files need taking down:  
https://github.com/hosch3n/hosch3n.github.io/tree/ef34c1bfa774634f9ce83d3ac0079ed6f5aee759/files

This repository contains a number of sensitive Cobalt Strike files, including licensing material, scripts used to bypass licensing in the main software, and other artifacts (the readme, for example!). The whole repository should be taken down:  
https://github.com/andromeda-rt/boc
