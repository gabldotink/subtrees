**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have DRM used to verify the integrity of the current game session. All of these "cracks" have illegally circumvented our DRM.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Since the project is written in Java, it is easier to circumvent than other projects. These cracks were made by modifying the bytecode of the JAR file and removing the integrity checks.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. They are listed above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**Which license?**

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Describe the change.**

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
