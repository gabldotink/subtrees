The user 7568(https://github.com/7568) have abused our code with no permission from us. Our code is posted privately, so 7568 should have had no legal access to our code. Our code is generated just for our service, LINER. The user 7568 is using our code with no permission and thus the codes should be taken down from his repository. For the following reasons, I hereby request DMCA takedown notice:

1. The codes user 7568 has posted on his repositories is the work of LINER's, generated by [private], [private] at LINRE Inc. It is clearly stated in the code that it is "Not allowed to be used by anyone, except the maker([private], [private] at LINER Inc). Thereby, the user 7568 does not have any rights to user the code owned by LINER.

2. The content on GitHub is unauthorized and infringing. We were not asked for the permission of using the codes and we did not get any notices of using our code. LINER did not authorize the user to use our code, so it is an infringement.

3. The user 7568 has abused our code. A whole of the code has been used, not just a small amount of copyrighted content. There are no transformations in the code and it is neither used for educational purposes nor any combination of the above.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
