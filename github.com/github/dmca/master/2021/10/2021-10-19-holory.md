Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

In past versions of the app, the 3D model in the app was not encrypted, so it was possible to extract data illegally.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Currently, the 3D model in the app is encrypted so that the data cannot be extracted.

The terms of use prohibit unauthorized extraction of data.
