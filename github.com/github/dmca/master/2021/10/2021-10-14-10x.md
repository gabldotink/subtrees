We have identified that the repository at https://github.com/lucasfontinele/react-native-threatmetrix is an unauthorised fork of a previous infringing repository taken down from GitHub following a DMCA request by our client.

This unauthorised fork provides access to at least the following infringing files which include markers specifically relating to our client and/or code proprietary to our client:

https://github.com/lucasfontinele/react-native-threatmetrix/blob/master/publish.sh

https://github.com/lucasfontinele/react-native-threatmetrix/blob/master/src/ios/TMXReactNative/DerivedData/BlinkIDReactNative/info.plist

This is a fork of a previous repository which consisted solely of unauthorised copies of our client’s proprietary source code. On the balance of probabilities, and having regard to the specific infringing files identified above, this fork would also appear to be infringing in its entirety. Unless the account holder is able to produce evidence identifying any files in this fork which do not include unauthorised reproductions of our client’s source code in whole or in part, the only acceptable solution to our client is removal of the entire repository. Our client is therefore requesting that you disable expeditiously this repository in its entirety in accordance with your DMCA Takedown Policy.
