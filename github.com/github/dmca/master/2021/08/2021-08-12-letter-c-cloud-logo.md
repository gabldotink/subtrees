Hi Github Copyright Agent



I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.



I am the copyright owner of the logo being infringed at:

https://github.com/creometry

The original “Letter C Cloud Logo” was published on June 17, 2020, and it is still available for sale on Scalebranding. The exclusive ready-made logo will be sold only once, and the copyright will automatically transfer from the designer to the buyer who has the option to register the logo as a trademark.



While we are delighted that the business owner would like to use this logo on their website, we require the business owner to purchase the original logo's rights through the LogoGround link below or delete it from their website.



The original work can be viewed at:

This letter is an official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) to effect removal of the reported infringement(s). I request that you promptly remove the infringing content and prevent the infringer from posting the infringing content to your servers in the future.



I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.



I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
