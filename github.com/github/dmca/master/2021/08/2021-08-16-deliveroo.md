Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Deliveroo is the owner of the copyright subsisting in the code and software in the Deliveroo application, which forms the basis of this takedown request. Details of the copyright and infringement are set out below. This form is submitted by a Deliveroo employee from the commercial legal team, with authorisation to act on behalf of the business.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringing content is source code which has been decompiled by a third party without the consent of Deliveroo, the copyright owner. The original work that was decompiled is version 3.54.1 of Deliveroo’s Android application which can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deliveroo.orderapp

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We request that the entire repository be removed. The infringing repository URL can be found here: https://github.com/sayokk7/deli

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched for any forks of the infringing repository. The result of fork searches can be found here: https://github.com/sayokk7/deli/network/members

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The application is not under an open source licence. The application is formed of proprietary code and consequently any use and/or reproduction in this form infringes Deliveroo copyright. Some third party dependencies which are part of the Deliveroo application are available under their own open source licences.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The infringement in this case can not be resolved by specific changes or amendments to the repository and/or relevant files. The repository must be removed.

No, we do not. We request GitHub’s assistance in identifying the infringer and resolving the infringement by removing the repository.
