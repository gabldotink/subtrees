**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the book's [private] and [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is [private] 1,200 page book that I spent years on, it's described at haskellbook.com and sold at lorepub.com. It is a comprehensive book used to learn the Haskell programming language. It isn't posted online for comparison because it's only available for sale and not for free. There's a free sample that can be downloaded from lorepub.com if you make an account.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

These repositories in their entirety:

https://github.com/githubpdfs/Haskell-Book  
https://github.com/ERDIV/Haskell-Book

These URLs are especially infringing:

https://github.com/githubpdfs/Haskell-Book/blob/master/Chris%20Allen%20%26%20Julie%20Moronuki%20-%20Haskell%20Programming%20from%20First%20Principles.pdf

https://github.com/ERDIV/Haskell-Book/blob/master/Chris%20Allen%20%26%20Julie%20Moronuki%20-%20Haskell%20Programming%20from%20First%20Principles.pdf

But all of the repository is infringing too.

They have reproduced the contents of many chapters of the book in markdown, such as in these files:

https://github.com/githubpdfs/Haskell-Book/blob/master/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve.md  
https://github.com/ERDIV/Haskell-Book/blob/master/chapter-twelve/chapter-twelve.md

This is well beyond what is covered by fair use doctrine although I appreciate that line can be a little fuzzy. There's no value-add, it's not a review, it's just reproduction of large portions of the book. The associated Haskell file for that markdown file reproduces exercises from that chapter and their answers as well. The exercises are much of the value of the book.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it's all rights reserved and they are infringing my copyright.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories need to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
