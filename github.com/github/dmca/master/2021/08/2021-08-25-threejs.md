Yes, I am the copyright holder.

I'm the [private] of Three.js Journey (https://threejs-journey.xyz/), a course to learn how to create WebGL websites using the Three.js library.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All the lessons are available as video and text on https://threejs-journey.xyz. Those repositories are a copy of the texts version of the lessons.
All those lessons are supposed to be private, which is why I can't simply show you an URL. But if needed, I can provide you with an access to the course.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

- https://github.com/Kaymind/threejs-journey  
- https://github.com/cedcodes/ThreeJS-Journey

All the files (markdowns, "exercice" folders, images, "final" folders).

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I found two repositories :  
- https://github.com/Kaymind/threejs-journey  
- https://github.com/cedcodes/ThreeJS-Journey

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It's not open source.  
Here are the the general conditions of sale and use https://threejs-journey.xyz/general-conditions

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I would prefer to have them remove from GitHub.
