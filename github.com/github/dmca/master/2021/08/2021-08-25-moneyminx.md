Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of Money Minx. We made the mistake of hiring a freelancer developer that decided it would be a good idea to publish the Money Minx front end code repo as an example of this work on his GitHub profile. [private] contacted and messaged him multiple times to remove the repo but he keeps republishing it and has now stopped responding to our request.

Money Minx owns the code in the repository. The freelancer barely committed a couple lines of code before we dropped him from the team as he was not a good fit, nor a good developer. He didn't know he also was a liar and would even go as far as publishing a copy of our code as his own and make it public on GitHub. I really hope you take action and find a way to block him from doing this to us again and to other victims.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our official repo is here: [private] this is a private repository, it is not open source or to be shared. It is IP owned by Money Minx for the purpose of running the MoneyMinx.com application.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repo found here: https://github.com/toptaldev92/money_minx should be taken down. This is a copy of our source code that he still has on his machine from when he worked for us for a brief of time.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

[private] found others in the past but he seems to be changing the name and making them more difficult to find. [private] found this one with the help of a good samaritan who was interviewing him for a freelance position and was shocked to see our entire repo published so he contacted us.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, there is no open source license. This is a private repo owned by Money Minx, Inc.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove the entire repo, he should not have it and should not try to publish it again.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I think he is changing his email to create new repos, right now his email is: [private] and GitHub is: https://github.com/toptaldev92

In the past he used:  
[private]  
[private]  
[private]
