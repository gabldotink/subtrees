To Whom It May Concern:

It has come to the attention of Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar) that GitHub, is hosting exfiltrated source code (the “Source Code”) containing our proprietary intellectual property, trade secrets and sensitive data from our wholly owned subsidiary Sustainalytics. Specifically, the Source Code comprises the entire code base of our Global Access application. You can find more information about this application at https://www.sustainalytics.com/global-access/.

The Source Code repository is located at https://github.com/heraSec/se and Morningstar is not aware of any known forks to this code.

The dissemination and use of the Source Code has not been authorized by Morningstar or its subsidiary, Sustainalytics and Morningstar has a good faith belief that the use and dissemination of the Source Code is not authorized under any applicable law, including fair use. Further, Source Code is not subject to any open-source licensing. Therefore, in addition to being a violation of GitHub’s own Acceptable Use Policy, the Source Code constitutes a clear violation of Section 1201 of The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA), which, among other things, prohibits technical measures/processes designed to circumvent copyright protections. For this reason, Morningstar is issuing this DMCA Take Down Notice to you asking that you promptly take down and remove the Source Code.

Under the penalty of perjury, Morningstar attests that the above information is accurate and that it is the copyright owner of the Source Code.

We have reviewed and understand GitHub’s Guide to filing a DMCA Notice. For security purposes we request that you remove the Source Code and sensitive data as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at [private] or [private].  

Sincerely,
