We are a small software development and cloud consulting orgization based out of Lahore Pakistan.  
The repository holds source code developed at XOHO TECH by XOHOTECH's [private]. All of the employees have signed contracts and IP agrements transfering all the rights to XOHO TECH. In 2020, Where AVP hired all of our current employees taking advantage of COVID and political situation in our contry and have them changed their emails from xohotech's emails to their personal emails or AVP given emails e.g. ([private], [private] and many more).

AVP and other personal involves are willfully and knowing lying and infringing our rights. We have contacted AVP many times which resulted in nothing.

XOHO TECH never had any contract or agreement with AVP. XOHO TECH never transfered or licensed anyone to use the source code. We are happy to share contracts signed by all the employees if needed which gives us all the rights for the given application. Github being the third party can verify the above facts by looking into the history for the accounts above.

If there are any contacts signed by XOHO TECH that we are not aware of please have the other party share details with us. The contact should have financialy statements backing that with dates, signee and nature of the work that needed to be delivered for any such contract.

It would be great if you can restore our repo. If you need any further details please feel free to reach out at [private].

Thanks

AVP may have providing a wrong agreement between XOHO TECH, INC. (which is a seprate org) and AVP back from 2017 which is between 2 different companies and never got executed. In past AVP tried to file a baseless law suite against XohoTech, Inc.. But they could not follow that up in court because the one false contract, never got executed and does not have any single penny of transaction backing that. Please take a looka the public court documents for this as well: [private]
