**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

my script shop for the fivem (https://rmscripts.tebex.io/package/4516988)

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic I've been creating my own shop selling my fivem scripts. (https://rmscripts.tebex.io/package/4516988) Unfortunately there are many leakers in this world and one of them created a repository just for that, to leak my work.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Broebie/pd_badge  
https://github.com/JonathanKh1996/newnew/tree/main/iconic-badge

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, the person himself bought the script and uploaded it for everyone to get it for free.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

When the person is purchasing the script, the website displays a message saying "RM Badge V2: When purchasing the script, be aware that you cannot refund and cannot leak the script."

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository can be private, only files cannot be shared.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
