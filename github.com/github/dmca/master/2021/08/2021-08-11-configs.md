**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a main contributor to a private repository [private], where I was the main and only creator of content. You can simply see by looking who created content there.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The (private) repository does not contain any licensing, so I believe content I created there are also owned by me, even after being removed from the org/repo.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[private]  
Since I cannot access the repository anymore, I can just say that there are folders inside that I created and content is affected:  
Folder valheim-server-pve-hard -> and/or content from there being transferred to other folders  
Folder valheim-server-pve-testing -> and/or content from there being transferred to other folders  
Folder valheim-server-houlgate2 -> since many of the contents are just plain copies from the content I created in the other folders

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not aware if the private forks exist that were created after I was removed

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I do not want to allow the repository owner or any other person of the organization to continue using the parts I created.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
