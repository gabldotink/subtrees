**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the software in question. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is [private] software, "Brainflayer - A proof-of-concept cracker for cryptocurrency brainwallets and other low entropy key alogrithms", located at https://github.com/ryancdotorg/brainflayer

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository is infringing. The user appears to have cloned [private] repo, made substantial modifications including changing the license, then re-uploaded it to their own account.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The following fork is also infringing and should be removed: https://github.com/kopykatA/brainFFlayer19

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is "All rights reserved" as noted in the file headers - it is not under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Making the repository private would not be acceptable, I want it removed. The repo was brought to my attention by an email from someone stating this user sold the software to them.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
