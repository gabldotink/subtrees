**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of Start Bootstrap LLC, and our copyright is stated on our premium products that we sell on our website. The product in question is a premium UI kit, of which I am [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The originally copyrighted work is a UI kit that is available for purchase on our website. The purchase page can be seen here: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-ui-kit-pro and our licensing terms are on our website here: https://startbootstrap.com/licenses.

The product demo is visible here: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/sb-ui-kit-pro.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

A GitHub user has posted our copyrighted product as a public repository here:  
https://github.com/dustarion/sb-ui-kit-pro

The copyright information can be seen in their repo, and we have verified that this user has purchased the UI kit, however they are in violation of the license by making the repository public.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, there are 5 forks that are also infringing on the copyright, and none of the forked repositories are verified purchasers, making the user who posted the product in a public repository responsible for potential lost sales.

https://github.com/AgentDavid/sb-ui-kit-pro  
https://github.com/alkhaf/sb-ui-kit-pro  
https://github.com/cnstd/sb-ui-kit-pro  
https://github.com/ovitlab/sb-ui-kit-pro  
https://github.com/SiamGameTh/sb-ui-kit-pro

The above forks are also in violation of our copyright.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licensed under an open source license. The original poster of the files at https://github.com/dustarion/sb-ui-kit-pro is in violation of our license terms, and the subsequent forks and untraceable downloads are able to access a former version of our paid product for free because of this license violation.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We ask that GitHub set the https://github.com/dustarion/sb-ui-kit-pro to private, since this was a verified purchase, and to remove the forks stated above since they were not verified purchasers of the product.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We have already emailed the infringer with no response. Their email address is listed publicly on GitHub along with their Twitter handle.
