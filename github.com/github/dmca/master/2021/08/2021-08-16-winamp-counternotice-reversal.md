GitHub has reversed the DMCA counter notice previously processed and published at: 

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/07/2021-07-29-winamp-counternotice.md

Based on additional review, GitHub has determined that the notice does not meet the requirements of our [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy) because the contact information provided in the counter notice was incomplete.  

Accordingly, GitHub has decided to reject this counter notice and keep the material in question disabled. Please note, should the submitter of the counter notice provide additional information, we will review it against our DMCA Takedown Policy to determine if additional action is necessary.
