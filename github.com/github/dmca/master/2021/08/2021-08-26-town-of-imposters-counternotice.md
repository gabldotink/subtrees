I am [private] of "Town Of Impostors" (Please check history to see)

I have also [private] the organisation of "Town Of Impostors" with a team.

In our Among Us mod, we allow our community to create their own hats which we can then add to the mod. We make sure that the users have the original files to prove that they have drawn it themselves.

Here is a link to the original .kra file created by the member of our community - who goes by the name "RSea" on discord (they have also hand-drawn and created many other hats for our mod):

Here is a link to the message/screenshot showing that our member of community drew this hat (hat shown on the far left of screenshot):

I would also like to point out that this mod of ours has been made free of charge, and anyone is able to download and use the mod. To reiterate, we do not charge any money for this mod and have not monetised it in any way.

We have made this mod for the community and it has always been this way. The "hat" that the complaining party is targeting was clearly drawn from scratch by a member of our community, and any similarities is pure coincidence.

I would also like to point out that the complaining party has their own Among Us mod at https://polus.gg/ that they have been monetising and are attempting to take down other mods to act as a monopoly.

The "hat" the complaining party is targeting is also the brand of "McDonalds". If there is any issue, it is that they are monetising the "McDonalds" brand which they do not own. Their full monetisations can be found on their Website, Patreon and Discord:

Whilst we follow fair usage, as we are not monetising anything and provide downloads for every release of our mod free of charge.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
