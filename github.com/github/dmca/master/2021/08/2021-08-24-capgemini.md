To whom this may concern,

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

I represent the interests of Capgemini, a company specialized in Cloud infrastructure services.

 

It has come to our attention that a user of your website named "Capgemini" published a part of code on December 9, 2014, for which Capgemini is the exclusive owner. This part of code was subsequently modified by a user named "[private]". The last modification of the part of code occurred on April 19, 2017. The code was developped for an intern purpose and must stay confidential while it as been created for a Capgemini’s Client.

  

To respond to your last request, the link to the specific file is on this following address:

 

https://github.com/mathieumomal/test/blob/cc75d2beec40c1b1642383572d2d35452c518036/web.config.prd

 

Capgemini, being the exclusive owner of this part of code, is the only authorized entity to publish, reproduce, distribute, transmit or modify the code except if it gives its express written consent authorizing such action.

However, Capgemini has never authorized anyone to publish this part of code. Consequently, the content of your website violates Capgemini's rights.

 

We remind you that, as a host of online content, you are responsible for illegal content published on your website once you are aware of its illegal nature. You are therefore obliged to act promptly to remove such information or to make access to it impossible. We are unable to contact the user "Capgemini" who posted this content because we do not have accurate information about the user's identity.

 

Therefore, we request that you immediately remove access to the part of code as it appears on your website.

 

If you fail to remove the contentious content, we will be forced to take legal action.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

You can contact us to this email address: [private]

Or to the following address: Capgemini Technology Services,

145-151 quai du Président Roosevelt, 92130 Issy-les-Moulineaux - France
