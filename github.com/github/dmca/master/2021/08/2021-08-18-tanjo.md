Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of [Tanjo.ai](http://Tanjo.ai), LLC, and have been authorized by our [private], [private], to report the illegal publication of our intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A disgruntled terminated employee of NCI Information Systems named [private] (cmorris2945) stole copies of two private codebases from Tanjo.ai, LLC. He publicly published both repositories using his own personal github account.

These two repos contain trade secret codebases and the intellectual property of Tanjo.ai, LLC.

This code is bound by strict licensing between Tanjo, NCI, and the employees of NCI (like [private]) to keep this codebase confidential and out of the public eye. In making these codebases public [private] is in violation of numerous contractual obligations and due to the governmental use of this codebase, potential criminal exposure.

The code in question is our legacy and current Topic Brain, NLP products. The original versions of this code can be found in the following PRIVATE repositories owned by the Tanjo organization:

The repositories that have been publicly published in violation of our non-disclosure agreements and privacy practices can be found here:

https://github.com/cmorris2945/Old_topic_brain_model

Searching for our name within the repos reveals ownership. Within the commit history, you will find a diagram outlining part of our proprietary infrastructure:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

A cursory search does not reveal any additional forks. The code was on the transgressor's machine post termination.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, all is private.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Complete removal of the code and provide a list of any parties that have downloaded the code if possible.
