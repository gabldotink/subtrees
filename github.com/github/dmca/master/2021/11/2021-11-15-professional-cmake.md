Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the ebook this notice is about.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] ebook "Professional CMake: A Practical Guide" is only legitimately available from [private] website. You can find it at https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/

Copies of the ebook are not allowed to be made available to anyone other than the purchaser.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/last-genius/comp_arch_list/blob/master/books/Professional%20CMake%20A%20Practical%20Guide.pdf

That file was added by commit [private], which needs to be removed from that repository.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No, although a legitimate version of the file should contain details of the purchaser at the bottom of each page. The PDF has been modified to remove those details.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The following forks also contain the offending commit with the same commit hash and therefore an unauthorised copy of the work:

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed. Either remove the commit from the git history or remove the entire repository (the file is not an authorized copy in any of the repositories).
