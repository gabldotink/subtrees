**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I represent the team that created WebDataRocks and was given the authority to report this case.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our product is a web pivot table available as a package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdatarocks. It is distributed under our custom license available here: https://www.webdatarocks.com/doc/licensing-terms-copyright/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaiyu-webdatarocks

This package contains an altered version of WebDataRocks. It contains the same files as our original package but with some modifications. For example, WebDataRocks Pivot has a 1 MB limitation for data loading. Kaiyu-webdatarocks changed this limitation so their copy of our pivot table does not have this limitation. Any altering or unauthorized modifications is explicitly prohibited by our license.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Did not find any of them.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not an open-source license, our custom license is available here: https://www.webdatarocks.com/doc/licensing-terms-copyright/.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since this package contains only WebDataRocks, the best solution would be to disable the entire package.
