Hello Dear Github:

We Are Wuhan Fiberhome Information Integration Technologies Co., Ltd. It is noce to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform ,and now we have a need to 
be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

We have read and understand GIthub's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.

Our company  created a repository called “[invalid]” on June 26,2019,which contains creator source code、project management and design documents are all owned by the company.Recently we found that the user name "KqSMea8" forked or copied our entire repository,and it still exists(url:https://github.com/KqSMea8/xjmxm).  
    
The following shows the material that is infringing the copyrighted and  we also had submmit taking down Tickets to Github support recently with the account "[private]"(Ticket ID: 1397765).  
  
a、The submmit history shows that  it's only once commit by the account "[private]",which is private,but forked by "KqSMea8"

b、The copyright belong to Fiberhome,from the source code package name or the pom.xml groupId 

b、The project management and design materials leak individual privacy.


Since the repository "KqSMea8/xjmxm" contains the company's important source code,algorithm and systemt configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove "KqSMea8/xjmxm" repository and thank you very  much.

Company Name:Wuhan Fiberhome Information Integration Technologies Co., Ltd.  
My Email Address: [private]

We had  attemped to  contact the author "KqSMea8",but he or she don't leave contact way,We submmited an PR to removed the contents without anything feedback.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
