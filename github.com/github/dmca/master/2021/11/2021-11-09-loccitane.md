To:  The DMCA Agent, Github Inc. 

Strategic IP Information Pte. Ltd. (a Singapore company) represents LABORATOIRES M&L, a company incorporated in France (hereinafter ‘our Client’), in the monitoring and worldwide enforcement of its intellectual property rights online. 

  

Our Client is the registered owner of the well-known trademarks L’OCCITANE and L’OCCITANE EN PROVENCE in numerous countries around the world. Furthermore, the images and data associated with the brand displayed or used on their official websites constitute original works in which our Client owns exclusive copyrights and related intellectual property (hereinafter the ‘Copyrighted Work’).   

  

It has come to our attention that the user “xhaerry” https://github.com/xhaerry  on your platform www.github.com, has published, without authorization, images and sensitive data (codes) in which our client owns the copyright. The relevant link and URLs are as follows: 

Link to the repository: https://github.com/xhaerry/xhaerry/tree/master/loccitane 
  

We have a good-faith belief that the publication of all or part of the Copyrighted Work has not been authorized by our Client or its agents. 

  

The repository of the user contains several elements that could be used to create a website similar to our Client’s official website, such as pages of codes and images of L’Occitane products. The creation or use of such a pirated website would be highly prejudicial to our Client.  

  

 This letter comprises official notification under §512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), and we seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. Please be advised that US law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. We also request you to immediately inform the infringers of this notice and advise them of their duty to remove the infringing material promptly and to cease any further posting of the infringing material to your server in the future.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have taken fair use into consideration.



Please acknowledge receipt of the letter as soon as possible.  

We declare, on behalf of our Client and under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is both true and accurate, and that we have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the Copyright Work involved.  

 

Yours sincerely,
