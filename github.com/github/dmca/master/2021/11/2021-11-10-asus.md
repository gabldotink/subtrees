Dear github, hello: I am very happy to have such a professional and efficient platform. I am an [private] of ASUS SUZHOU Technology Co., Ltd. The company granted me a request to delete the source code that was given to fork. I very much hope to get help and support from github. I have read and understood Github's "Guidelines for Submitting DMCA Notifications".

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original warehouse I created at 2019-11-15 is [private] (now this warehouse has been requested to be deleted by the company, and I can’t see the record in my personal warehouse). 2019-11-15 was downloaded by others and re-uploaded to the repository, which contained too much sensitive information, such as secret keys, database addresses, etc. Important production environment information configuration and so on. If this information is discovered by others, the company will face serious economic losses, and I will also face severe legal penalties.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
