**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

One of the freelancers that has contributed to our company repository has uploaded our private proprietary source code as PUBLIC repo. This must be taken down immediately.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The online repository is available at: [private]  However, this is a private repository.  As such, we are attaching the screen shots of the README file of the [private] repo (1-5 attached pngs).  You can see that offending project (test-project below) is essentially a duplication of our repo at an earlier state.  I am also attaching the commit history, which is identical up to the point in time in which the test-project rests. 

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/highdev2016/test-project

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. No other seems currently available.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I no longer have it. But his username is definitely the same as he used to use when contributing to our repository.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
