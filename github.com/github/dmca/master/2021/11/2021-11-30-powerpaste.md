Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The compiled source code for PowerPaste can be accessed via subscription. The subscription provides a valid API key which can be used to consume the code via our cloud distribution channel. Alternatively the subscriber can download the code after logging into the members area [https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/)

The terms of use policy forbids re-distributing the source code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project has made the source code publicly available on GitHub, this bypasses our license and measures taken to keep the code available to subscribers described above.

In addition, the code can also be forked by the public which also bypasses our protection measures.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have checked all the forks from this project
