Handsome is a fee-based personal theme. The current version is 8.2.1. They are closed-source and charged starting from version 3.x (if I remember correctly). This repository is the last open source version（maybe 2.x） before their closed-source (you can view ihewro's git log record and the license under the repository).This version is open sourced by the author himself on GitHub (see git log). It cannot be said that the later version will be charged, and the open source version will be returned.
