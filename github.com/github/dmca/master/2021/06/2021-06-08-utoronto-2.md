It has recently came to our attention that one of our projects developed by aUToronto were wrongly uploaded to GitHub without permission. The project contains drivers for our vehicle's sensors and associated communication interface. The IPs are owned by the group and are not supposed to be open-sourced to the public.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We have submitted 2 DMCA requests ([private] and [private]) including the forks we identified previously. Unfortunately there is a new fork created in the past few days:

https://github.com/forkeruser/ARS430_RDI_Driver

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the projects are not open-sourced.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories must be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
