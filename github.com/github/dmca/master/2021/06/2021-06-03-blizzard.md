**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We represent Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard"). Blizzard is the owner of copyright in the video game "Diablo 2" and the forthcoming Diablo 2 remaster titled "Diablo 2: Resurrected." We have become aware of certain GitHub repositories offering (1) copies of the Diablo 2: Ressurected client, and (2) code that circumvents authorization protocols and technology designed to limit access to the Diablo 2: Resurrected Alpha version in development. The files infringe Blizzard's copyright and is technology that circumvents access control protections, and therefore violates Section 1201 of the Copyright Act.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

"Diablo II: Resurrected," a video game published by Blizzard. Information about Diablo II: Resurrected can be found at: https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[invalid]

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, see below.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is copyrighted.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository itself has been removed following Blizzard's demand to the infringer that it be removed. However, Blizzard urgently needs the forks above removed as well, as the content contained therein is causing harm to Blizzard.

Blizzard has taken the following technological measures to control access to its copyrighted material: the implementation of cyclic redundancy checks ("CRC32"), which are designed to check the games core-components/code to ensure that nothing within it has been modified. If any changes are found to have been made to the game, the integrity checks will stop the game from being executed/ran. By bypassing these checks users can make changes to the games core-components/code.

The project at issue is designed to circumvent Blizzard's technological protection measures by allowing for the bypassing of the CRC32 integrity checks. These integrity checks are there to scan memory regions of the game in order to check whether the code for the game has been modified before it is executed/ran.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
