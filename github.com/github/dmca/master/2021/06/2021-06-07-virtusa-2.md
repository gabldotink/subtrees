**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/abineshabi82/spring-mvc-hibernate

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The reported repository URL contains the entirety of the import packages of their website. The fork also leads to the entire repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The original script came from Virtusa's website; as such they are licensed by copyright rights.

Delete the entire repository for infringement of source material.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We have no access to the infringer's contact details.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
