**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice"  
I am [private] of BrokrBindr.com. We publish a SaaS to assist mortgage brokers in Canada.  
The source code belongs to our company, and my family owns the company.

Our legitimate source code is stored on GitHub, here:  
[private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/danielwebdevel/opus2-mortgage-brokrbindr

*** Please note that this is the second time in 30 days that our source has been openly published on Github. ***

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository is our code, and nothing but our code (though it seems to include a rip from our marketing website now as well).  
It should all be removed immediately.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched, and found no other repository containing our code.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This work is certainly NOT open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only solution is for the offending party to remove (and delete) this code that does not belong to him.

*** Please note that this is the second time in 30 days that our source has been openly published on Github. ***

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We only have what we see on Github: [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
