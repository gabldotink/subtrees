**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the project.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida is a JavaScript framework to operate in global financial markets, the MetaTrader software was included in https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida-Brokerage, the repository has already been removed, even before the DMCA takedown. While https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida was not containing any copyright infringement.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. There was a misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. The repository https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida has nothing to do with the reported DMCA and is not containing any illegal file or copyright infringement, in fact MetaQuotes Ltd failed to identify any problems with the repository https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida. The repository to take down was https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida-Brokerage, containing the MetaQuotes Ltd code, which has already been removed before the DMCA takedown as requested by MetaQuotes Ltd. MetaQuotes Ltd is illegaly trying remove my project instead of just the files regarding the infringement. The infringement made by https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida-Brokerage was right and I proceeded with the removal as requested by MetaQuotes Ltd. While the take down of https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida it's a violation of my rights, if MetaQuotes Ltd thinks that any of the files in https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida needs to be removed, then it's required to provide a specific explanation of file path and infringement as they have done with https://github.com/Reiryoku-Technologies/Mida-Brokerage which I have successfully removed.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
