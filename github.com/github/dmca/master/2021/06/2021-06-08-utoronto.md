**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of aUToronto (University of Toronto's self-driving car development group, https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca) and I act on the group's behave to protect the copyrighted content developed by our researchers and developers.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It has recently came to our attention that two projects developed by aUToronto were wrongly uploaded to GitHub without permission. The projects contain drivers for our vehicle's sensors and associated communication interface. The IPs are owned by the group and are not supposed to be open-sourced to the public.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Our previous takedown request (Ticket ID: [private]) missed one of the forks. The owner was contacted but did not reply to us.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, the fork owner has been notified.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the project is not open-sourced.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository must be taken down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
