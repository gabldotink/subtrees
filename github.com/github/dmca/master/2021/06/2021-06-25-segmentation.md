Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I posted a repository "[private]" and I inadvertently posted data that belong to a third party. The third party threatened to sue me if the data is not removed. I deleted the repository from my account.

There are 4 users who forked the repository. I was able to contact one, and he agreed to remove the repo. For one user who didn't have a contact information, you already took down the repository.

I contacted the other 2 users, but they never replied.
Could you please ask these 2 users: 'https://github.com/czarius' and 'https://github.com/xxjimi' to delete the repository.  
The links to the forked repositories are: 'https://github.com/czarius/Attention-Enriched-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation'  
and 'https://github.com/xxjimi/Attention-Enriched-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation'.  

Thank you,

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As I mentioned, the copyrighted work is about a dataset of breast ultrasound images. The owners of the dataset gave me access, but I didn't realize that they prohibited redistribution of the dataset. The owners contacted me recently, and asked me to ask all users who forked the repository to delete it, or else they will sue me.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take down the entire repository at: 'https://github.com/czarius/Attention-Enriched-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation'
The user "czarius" forked the repository from my github page.

Please take down the entire repository at: 'https://github.com/xxjimi/Attention-Enriched-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation'
The user "xxjimi" forked the repository from my github page.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I searched, and I contacted personally the 2 users who forked the repository.

I contacted both "czarius" and "xxjimi" about 3 months ago, but they never replied.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the data is owned by a third party, and I inadvertently posted it on github. I wasn't aware of it at the time.  
I deleted the repository from my github page.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The owner of the data requested that the users delete the repository. The owner is mad that I posted the data on github.  
I deleted the repository from my github page.  
The owner ask me to ensure that all forks are deleted.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I wrote a comment on repositories on github owned "czarius" and "xxjimi" about 2 months ago, but they never replied.  
I don't have their email addresses otherwise.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
