**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) is the owner of the copyright to the software that is in question for this DMCA Takedown request. I was authorized to submit this request by the [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work that has been infringed upon is the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite: https://spec.org/cpu2006/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files under the following directory should be taken down: https://github.com/sahilpparmar/llvm_backend/tree/master/mytest/spec2006.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All the forks associated with the post by this user should also be removed. The following forks should be removed:  
https://github.com/arnamoy10/llvm_backend/tree/master/mytest/spec2006  
https://github.com/bceylan/llvm_backend/tree/master/mytest/spec2006

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. The SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark suite is licensed by SPEC (spec.org) and licenses to the software are sold by SPEC.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The user posting the benchmark suite should remove it from GitHub. All forks should also be removed from GitHub. Making the repositories private is not a valid option as SPEC's records do not indicate that the user(s) has a license. It could be that they obtained a copy from a licensed organization, company, or educational institute. If so, those who hold the license should not have allowed the benchmark suite to be posted.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The only contact information I have for the infringer is the email address posted to his GitHub account: [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
