I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I'm working for USA based startup Wisdom Cafe for last 6 months or so and I recently discovered that our whole backend repo has been published publically by someone without any authorization. Currently, we're managing our repo in a private repo but it's been published by someone 8 months ago

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Here is link to our private repo

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Currently, the publich repository which want to be taken down doesn't have any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it's not under an open source license. It's a private repo which has been released publically by someone without any permission.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This repo should be deleted as someone has stolen it from us.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We don't know anything about him/her except following github username on which this repo has been published
