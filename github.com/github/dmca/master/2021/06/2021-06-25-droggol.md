Hello Sir,

I am writing here on behalf of Droggol www.droggol.com  
We have a git repository at [private] and we listed our Odoo modules there. All our modules are registered on odoo apps store and here are app store links,
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/themes/14.0/theme_prime/  
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/14.0/droggol_theme_common/  
and both modules contain Odoo Proprietary License v1.0 (OPL-1)  
The [private] Github user published our Odoo Proprietary License v1.0(OPL-1) 's code as a public repository please check the below links which have our module and it's published as a public repo.  
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/droggol_theme_common  
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/theme_prime  
This all repository contains our odoo-python modules droggol_theme_common, theme_prime which is registered as Proprietary modules by Droggol. I will give you more details in the below section.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our apps need to be purchased from the Odoo app store and then the buyer can not put them publically.  
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/themes/14.0/theme_prime/  
https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/14.0/droggol_theme_common/  
here is the link to our private repository on GitHub which contains our modules
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/droggol_theme_common  
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/theme_prime

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Here is the path which contains our modules  
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/droggol_theme_common  
https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo/apolo/tree/main/theme_prime  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

For the moment there are no forks of that repo.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our modules are having Proprietary License called Odoo Proprietary License v1.0 (OPL-1)  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

If they make their repository private that would work.  
But if he/she does not make this repository then Please down the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I just know Github user which is https://github.com/miguelramirezodoo
