**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

In the repository's commits, you will see I ([private]) am the only author:
https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6/commits/master

The whole content in the repository was finished between 2014 and 2015 and I put it under my own github repository:
[private]
I accidentally made it public though.
This repository was deleted 2 or 3 years ago when I realised it was public since it's not meant to be publicly visible.

This repository didn't fork my work, but instead copy & paste it completely into her/his own repository:
https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6
The repository has all history commits information which shows me as the single author and my copyright ownership.

The other one forked the one above:
https://github.com/xxdoc/vb6-7

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

These 2 repositories has the exact code I wrote with all my commit histories:

https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6  
https://github.com/xxdoc/vb6-7  

https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6/commits/master  
https://github.com/xxdoc/vb6-7/commits/master  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I believe these 2 repositories should be taken down:

https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6
https://github.com/xxdoc/vb6-7

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

yes.
https://github.com/xxdoc/vb6-7
is the only fork of
https://github.com/mywilliamhe/vb6

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

no. The repository is not open sourced at all.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

These 2 repositories should be removed completely first to show respect to my copyright.
After that, they are free to contact me for permission to use my code.
I need to make some changes to my repository in order to be sure the code is ready for public usage.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

no.
I mean, I'd contact "mywilliamhe" beforehand if I had any contact information.
But in her/his page, there is not even an email, not to mention phone number.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
