Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of aUToronto (University of Toronto's self-driving car development group, https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca) and I act on the group's behave to protect the copyrighted content developed by our researchers and developers.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It has recently came to our attention that two projects developed by aUToronto were wrongly uploaded to GitHub without permission. The projects contain drivers for our vehicle's sensors and associated communication interface. The IPs are owned by the group and are not supposed to be open-sourced to the public.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We have contacted the original infringer and also owners of the forked repos. Some were taken down but a few forked repos remain accessible.
