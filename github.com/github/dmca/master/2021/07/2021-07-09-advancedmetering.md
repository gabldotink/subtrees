**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The code was developed exclusively for the Advanced Metering Services LLC company.
I represent the company as a [private] of the project.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our private code repository was cloned to GitHub few years ago and we noticed this only now.
Repository: [invalid]  
You can see copyright in all the source code files. Ex.:  
[invalid]  
[invalid]  
etc.  

I do not see any changes done to the repository after initial clone.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Entire repository: https://github.com/growlot/ASP.NET-Listener

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I'm not aware of any other forks of the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Complete removal is requested.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have the contact information other than his GitHub account: https://github.com/growlot  
I'm assuming this is one of the developers who was hired to work on the project, but the username is not familiar to me, so I can not identify specific developer I should look for.  
If you can provide any contact information for this user, I could contact them directly with request to remove the repository.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
