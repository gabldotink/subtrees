**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the repository Library Management System and all code this project contains is [private] and released under the MIT license.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I released my project under the MIT license which got violated as this person re uploaded my project without forking or without the proper MIT license. I contacted him regarding the issue and he promised he will take down the repository. Instead he uploaded a license with his name. I came to know about this when this person tried submitting my work (with some mere color and font changes) as his submission to a company's dev test. If required I can submit the mail notification of an issue deleted by this person where the company's recruiting team notified me about this.

The original repository is a web application to manage a library.  
https://github.com/lafith/library-management-system

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository to be taken down is at:  
https://github.com/Ayushparikh-code/Library-Management-Web-Application

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forked repository has been found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The project is licensed under the MIT license. The MIT License is a very simple license that requires the original copyright notice(s) remain present. The MIT License is being violated due to the removal of the project's copyright notice: Copyright (c) 2021 Lafith Mattara.  
The absence of this notice is a clear violation of the MIT License as quoted below.  
"The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software."

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I'd prefer to have the repository removed or he can fork my repository and add his contributions to it, keeping my commit history.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
