Attention: DMCA Agent, GitHub Inc.

This is a takedown notice sent on behalf of Northwoods Software Corporation pursuant to Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and npm, Inc.'s Copyright and DMCA Policy found at https://www.npmjs.com/policies/dmca.

I have recently learned that npm is making available some copyrighted materials of Northwoods Software Corporation without its permission.  Those materials are being made available as the npm package named "fql_flow".  The materials have been modified, contrary to the license agreement governing use of the software, which prohibits modifying or creating derivative works.

The original materials, that are owned by Northwoods Software Corporation and protected by copyright, can be found at:  
    https://gojs.net/2.1.5  
Those materials include, but are not limited to, the following documents:  
    https://gojs.net/2.1.5/release/go.js 

The infringing materials are in the npm package "fql_flow":  
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/fql_flow  
That package is available as these archive files when downloaded from the registry via npm pack:  
    https://registry.npmjs.org/-/fql_flow-1.0.0.tgz  
The infringing documents include but are not limited to one or more of the following documents within those archives:  
    package/go.js

The distribution of our unmodified software via npm is not a problem for us.  The distribution of a modified copy of our software is the behavior that we cannot accept.

Please remove and disable all access to the npm package:  
    fql_flow  
and all of its contents and their archives, for all versions, immediately and world-wide.

I provide this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that the rights of Northwoods Software Corporation are being infringed, even after taking fair use into consideration.  I declare under penalty of perjury that this notice is accurate and that I have the authority to act on behalf of Northwoods Software Corporation.
