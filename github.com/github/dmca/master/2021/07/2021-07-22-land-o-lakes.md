**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The data is owned by Land O’Lakes, Inc. and I am an [private] authorized to make this request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The work is a set of system test scripts. The test scripts were created by a contractor of Land O’Lakes, Inc. through the course of their employment with the company and should have never been placed on a public repo.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

3 entire repositories:  
https://github.com/NitishAutomation/LOL  
https://github.com/NitishAutomation/LOLGitHub  
https://github.com/NitishAutomation/ITSM

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched and found no forks of these repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These works are proprietary and therefore not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal of the entire repositories is the best solution as these scripts are for use exclusively with Land O’Lakes, Inc. systems.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No contact information for the user is available.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
