GitHub, Inc  
Attn: DMCA Agent  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA. 94107  

Dear GitHub:

I am [private] to Akamai Technologies, Inc. (“Akamai”). I
have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, and I am submitting
this letter to request the immediate removal of certain content (further described below)
at the following repository: GitHub - [invalid]

This repository includes content that infringes one or more of Akamai’s
copyrights and/or constitutes an impermissible use of Akamai’s proprietary information. Specifically, and at the specific links included herewith, Akamai’s proprietary, copyrightprotected code and other confidential information has been posted to GitHub. None of
the materials have been published by Akamai or are otherwise available publicly. In the
Schedule appended to this letter, I have identified several files (marked “Exact”) that
consist exclusively of Akamai code, as well as several other files that include Akamai
code. For the latter group of files, I have also, in each case, specified the lines
corresponding to Akamai’s code.

The offending repository has been forked on one (1) occasion, and the forked
repository is: GitHub - arnabs542/common_project

We have investigated and analyzed the above-identified fork and believe that it is
also infringing, as it also includes all of the files listed in the attached Schedule.

For the sake of clarity, the code and information specified in the attached
Schedule is Akamai’s proprietary code and confidential information. Thus, the
referenced content should be removed from both repositories. In particular, the files
marked Exact should be removed in their entirety. For the remaining files, the particular
lines identified in the Schedule should be excised. 


I have a good faith belief that the use of the material described above is not
authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into
consideration.

I swear under penalty of perjury that, that the information in this notification is
accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the
owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

We have investigated the forked repository and that the sworn statements apply to
the identified fork.

The contact name of the owner of the [invalid] repository is
[private], of [private]. [private] is a former Akamai employee. We do not
have [private] physical address, but [private] phone number is believed to be [private],
and [private] email address is believed to be [private]. We do not have
information about the owner of the forked repository, other than the GitHub name.
To the extent that you have questions regarding, or otherwise would like to
discuss, this takedown request, please do not hesitate to contact me at
[private], or by phone at [private].

 Given the nature of the materials that have posted improperly, Akamai requests
that GitHub act expeditiously to remove its code and information from these repositories.
Akamai thanks you in advance for your cooperation.

Very truly yours,



[private]
