Dear Github

We act on behalf of our client, Substrate. It has come to our attention that a website hosted by Github Pages and its associated repository is infringing on Substrate's copyrights. We request your cooperation to have the infringing content removed.

The infringing website is found at:  https://core.tetcoin.org  
The repository serving the website is found at: https://github.com/tetcore/tetcore.github.io/  
The relevant index file for the website is found at: https://github.com/tetcore/tetcore.github.io/blob/master/index.html  
*Please note that the entire repository is serving the infringing website. It is not all centred in the index file.

The original material of our client is at: https://substrate.dev/

The infringer has copied and used Substrate's source code and content from our clientâ€™s website to build an identical website and product, creating confusion for Substrate's customers and therefore harm to the business of our client. Our client is not related to nor does it have any affiliation to the infringer and the infringing content was published on your servers without Substrate's permission. We request the infringing material be deleted in its entirety, alternatively that the code and/or content be sufficiently re-worked to create a new product that does not resemble our client's code, website, and/or content in any respect.

We are sending this notice under a good faith belief that use of the materials, described above as allegedly infringing, is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. We certify, under the penalty of perjury, that the information in this notice is correct. We have the authority to act on behalf of the person who owns the copyright in question.

We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
