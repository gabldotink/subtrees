There should be some missing privacy in the code. I can't locate each place accurately, so I hope to delete the entire code directly. The code link is: https://github.com/un-knower/GIT_LYRPROJECT  
Thanks

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I hope that the entire code will be removed, because it not only contains the user password, IP, port, but also the source code of all functions  
https://github.com/un-knower/GIT_LYRPROJECT

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There is a fork record, I hope it can also be deleted  
https://github.com/wangsen1990?tab=repositories

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it was misinformed, and then I tried to delete it, but it was not why it appeared under the un-knower user again

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Of course I want to delete all of them, but now this sub-code has been transferred to the un-knower user. I have no permission to modify and upload the code, nor can it be for privacy and invisibility.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
