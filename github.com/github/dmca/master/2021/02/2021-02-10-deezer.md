Sir/Madam,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  

I represent the French company DEEZER SA registered in the Paris Trade and Commercial Register under No 511 716 573, having its registered office at 26 rue de Calais 75009 Paris, France.

DEEZER, under the corporate name and word trademark DEEZER [and semi-figurative trademark image.png] (the “Deezer Trademarks”) offers, since 2012, an international online music on demand service, through free and paying services (the “Deezer Services”), with a formidable presence on the Internet and has acquired renown in the music industry and among Internet users.


Our company owns or is the licensee of the intellectual property rights in, notably, the Deezer Trademarks, the general structure of the website www.deezer.com and the corresponding software application “Deezer”, available under iOS, Android and Windows systems, and all elements composing them (such as but not limited to the logos, trademarks, domain names, content, and their associated elements such as the potos, images, texts and biography of the authors, artists and/or any legal beneficiary on the Content). Every musical or non-musical content on our platform is protected by copyright law.

To control the use, modification, and distribution of the Deezer Content, Deezer has put in place strong Digital Right Management tools. The Deezer Services, as made available on the above-mentioned website and mobile application, as well as our computer systems, servers and network are protected by extremely high level encryption. Indeed, Deezer uses an encryption algorithm to encrypt all the Deezer content, including Deezer’s phonograms and others producers’ phonograms stored in Deezer’s servers in order to prevent their downloads by unauthorized persons.

Amongst other things, security is set so as to prohibit any other use than those stipulated in our Terms and Conditions (http://www.deezer.com/legal/cgu). The unauthorized download of music tracks is prohibited, as well as any reproduction and/or making available all or part of the Site, the Application, the Deezer Services and/or the elements composing them (as described above), by any means is forbidden and would be treated as an infringement punishable by law.

We have discovered that the following links make available Github repositories created to make available softwares which enable users to download the Deezer Content without any authorization. To do so, these repositories are sharing the private encryption keys retrieved maliciously to bypass Deezer's security measures to unlawfully download its music catalogue, directly from Deezer’s servers in total violation of our rights and those of our music licensors (phonographic producers, performing artists, songwriters and composers).

By creating and developing these projects, the developers have knowingly procured or offered to others, without our authorization, a mean especially dedicated to the circumvention of our effective technological measures, in order to allow unauthorized persons to directly download our phonograms and others producers’ phonograms out of our servers.

I therefore ask that you immediately take down the projects made available via the URLs above.

The above is a brief description of the violations at stake and is not meant to be a complete statement of our company's prejudice, rights and remedies in connection with the subject matter of this email. All such rights and remedies are expressly reserved, including the rights and remedies of our licensors.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web page is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I look forward to hearing from you promptly.

Sincerely,
