Dear GitHub:

In response to the DMCA takedown notice procedure as provided on the online guide,
SUEZ North America, Inc. (“SUEZ”) states the following:

I, [private], on behalf of SUEZ, have read and understand GitHub’s guide to filing
a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described [below]
on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent,
or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate
and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner,
of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Below is our statement of the copyrighted work that has been infringed by the alleged perpetrator
along with the list of material we identified as infringed information.

A brief history about us and how the information posted on Github.com is related
to us. SUEZ North America was originally founded as the Hackensack Water
Company in 1896 and later named United Water, with a headquarters in Paramus,
N.J. In 2000, United Water became a subsidiary of SUEZ Environment, a French
Utility Company. United Water, in 2015, rebranded its name under the parent
company, SUEZ, and is now operating in North America under its DBA as SUEZ
North America.

Now, the information posted on the github respository has a list information that is
owned and managed by SUEZ North America (under our United Water Brand). This
includes code, Scripts, Active Directory information, internal computer directories,
list of computer names, domains, device types, operating systems, and other
pertinent information that we are requiring for github to remove from your site.

There are over 50 PowerShell scripts that SUEZ North America created, manages,
and maintains, which searches and retrieves confidential information within our
infrastructure to test the validity of our security and privacy related audits in
compliance with regulatory entities. The code used is to scan our network and
infrastructure, pulls computer names, usernames, and other information related to
our United Water domain and extracts it for auditing purpose. For example, SUEZ
[private].

Now, these scripts were mostly created by SUEZ and were built to not be shared
with the public. We maintain the integrity of our proprietary information and due to
the actions by [private], we are seeking every legal avenue to remove the pertinent
information that we own and manage. As mentioned in previous requests, we have
tried to contact [private] directly and we have not received any response.
Accordingly, we are now contacting your division to remove the pertinent
information from the public's view. We are seeking to have this information
removed within 30 days of the initial receipt of the request and in accordance with
SUEZ's Privacy Rights.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.
I have identified the URLs that we are requesting you to remove - see previous
emails and the URLs listed below (Scripts and codes in the URL Links below)

My contact information:  
o Name: [private]  
o Title: [private]  
o Email: [private]  
o General: [private]

a risk impact analysis and have listed each of the URLS that we are requesting your
