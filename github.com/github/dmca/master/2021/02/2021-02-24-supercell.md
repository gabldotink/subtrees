Supercell Oy  
Notice of Copyright Infringement and Other Violations by autoclashbotios.com  

To Whom it May Concern,  

This law firm represents Supercell Oy (“Supercell”), creator of some of the most engaging and successful mobile games in the world, including Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Hay Day, and Boom Beach.

A website that you either host or that you provide pass-through services for, autoclashbotios.com (https://autoclashbotios.com, hereinafter the "Infringing Site"), infringes Supercell’s rights and tortiously interferes with contracts between Supercell and its customers.

We request that you immediately and permanently remove and disable the Infringing Site from your hosting service, or if you are providing only pass-through service for the Infringing Site, we request that you disable that pass-through service, forward this letter to the domain host of the Infringing Site, and inform us of the identity of the domain host so that we can follow up with the host accordingly.

Infringement of Supercell’s Intellectual Property and Other Tortious Activity

Supercell owns all legal rights to use and enforce all copyrights in its games Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Hay Day, and Boom Beach, including use of images and icons from those games. Supercell also owns registered trademarks for its games (cf. Exhibit 1). As the games rank amongst the most popular mobile games in the world, the names and popular abbreviations of such games are notorious amongst gamers.
Finally, Supercell owns unregistered title rights in the games in jurisdictions where title rights exist, e.g. Germany.

The Infringing Website uses graphics from the game Clash of Clans. Supercell holds the rights, and never authorized such actions. The Infringing Website also promotes cheat bots. Such cheat bots have been found illegal copyright infringements by court in many jurisdic- tions, including the US, the UK, and Germany.

Screenshots of the above incidents of infringement are attached as Exhibit 2.

The Infringing Website appears to use your Internet service to either host or provide pass- through services for the Infringing Website. Accordingly, we request that you (1) immediately and permanently remove and disable access to the Infringing Website; and (2) take steps to ensure that Infringing Website is not re-posted on, re-linked to, or otherwise made available through your system.

No later than

February 10, 2021,

please confirm in writing that you have complied with this request.

The information set forth in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am authorized to act on behalf of Supercell, the owner of exclusive rights under trademark and copyright in the works identified herein. I have a good faith belief that Infringing Website use of Supercell’s material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Sincerely,
