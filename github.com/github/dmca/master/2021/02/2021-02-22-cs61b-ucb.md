Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for the CS61B in charge of taking down online solutions/skeleton code from past semesters. As a department, we own not just the skeleton files but the solutions themselves. The skeleton files, solutions, specifications, graders, and introductory material have all been authored by the department and are our sole property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am writing on behalf of the creator and owner of one or more copyrighted works appearing on your web site, which can be found on http://fa20.datastructur.es/. Further, this material can be found in the following repository belonging to the institution hosted on GitHub:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have searched for forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

I am writing to you concerning the unauthorized reproduction, display or other use of those copyrighted works on the site. The author of this material has not granted permission or license for you to post or otherwise use those materials.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

All above users need to make all repositories containing any skeleton, solution, or discussion of the above content private. Removing the repositories is also a satisfactory solution for us. They may allow permissions to specific users who are not associated with the institution, but they must never allow permissions by the general public or any student currently enrolled in any UC Berkeley course.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
