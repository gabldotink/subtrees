Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm [private] of EZ Optimizer for Cyberpunk 2077. The program has a copyright notice

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The one and only place where I ever published the program was the description of my YouTube video with the tutorial to EZ Optimizer. It was published on December 27, 2020.

Direct link to the program: [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

User DartPower decompiled and published the source code of my closed-source program here: https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/issues/317#issuecomment-751497418

Additionally, he made a post that has defamatory nature and falsely accusing my program while promoting another one.

For the detailed description please see my post in GitHub Support Community [private]  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks that I can find

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No open-source license since this is a closed source program that I never planned to publish on GitHub

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only solution I see is the removal of the posted source code together with a defamatory topic.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

His contact information posted on his profile page. I tried to contact him and asked to delete it since he can see in the comments, that other members pointed him that it's not malware, so his accusations are false and damage the reputation. Additionally, several members said that posting a source code is plainly not right, against GitHub policy, and even illegal. He refused to do so because he's likely generating the traffic to his social media through this topic, since the keywords "EZ Optimizer" has a high search volume, and he believes that he can get away with DMCA violation (his own words from our conversation on VK.com)
