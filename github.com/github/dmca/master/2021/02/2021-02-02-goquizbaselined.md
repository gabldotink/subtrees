It has come to our attention that a file containing copyrighted content of our organization which was taken down by GitHub from [private] , [private], and [private] is forked by
the account of “nshar1055” at : https://github.com/nshar1055/GoQuizBaseLined .

We have tried to contact the account owner but due to lack of contact details we were unable to do so.

Since, the project hosted @ https://github.com/nshar1055 account is the forked version of a copyrighted project, which exposes our organization’s proprietary data, we request GitHub to get this project removed from nshar1055’s account permanently from GitHub without leaving any trail or back up.

Given the criticality of the matter, we urge you to take this request forward expeditiously and would require an immediate action from your side to take down the files permanently without leaving any trail or back-up in the GITHUB systems.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following are the details of the file that needs to be removed:

Line Number: Entire Project needs to be taken down as it is a fork of an copyright infringing file  
Issue: Fork of a copyrighted file which was confirmed to be taken down by GitHub via a DMCA notice on 22nd December 2020.  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
