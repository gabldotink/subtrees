Re:        Cellebrite DI Ltd Takedown Request

 

Dear DMCA Agent:

 

We are [private] to Cellebrite DI Ltd (“Cellebrite”).  This letter is to request an immediate and permanent take down of our client’s stolen code and other confidential and proprietary information on the pages accessed through the GitHub link: https://github.com/cellebrited/cellebrite (the “Infringing Pages”).

 

Please be advised that GitHub user, “Cellebrited” (the “Infringer”), has uploaded multiple Cellebrite software files and other Cellebrite proprietary and confidential information (collectively, the “Cellebrite Proprietary Information”) to the Infringing Pages thereby exposing this sensitive information to the world for free and unrestricted use. 

 

There is no doubt that the Infringer’s unlawful actions were willful and malicious.  In fact, on the Infringing Pages, the Infringer admitted its nefarious actions and objectives – and its explicit violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §1201(A)(1)(a) -- by circumventing technological measures that effectively controlled access to all or part of the Cellebrite Proprietary Information, and by facilitating and encouraging others to similarly circumvent technological measures controlling access to the Cellebrite Proprietary Information, in explaining:

 

         The exploit techniques that Cellebrite employ are wrapped in various encryption schemes in an attempt to protect 'their' intellectual property.  The custom routines for decrypting this lame ass protection are included in this release along with an

         accompanying sample .eas (DLL designed to target devices and applications) and .epr

         (bootloaders, exploits and shellcode) files.

 

The Cellebrite Proprietary Information has been registered in at least five (5) U.S. Software Copyrights with the United States Copyright Office as listed in Exhibit A annexed hereto.

 

In order to facilitate the prompt takedown of the Cellebrite Proprietary Information, please find our contact information below:
