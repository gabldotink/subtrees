Yes, I am the copyright holder.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I ([private]) and my company (SCF Ventures LLC) own the exclusive copyright to all the code for a mobile application codenamed [private]. My company hired developers in the past to develop the mobile application, but every developed signed an NDA and Copyright attestation document.

We were informed by Google a couple of weeks ago that our private API Key for Google Maps was discovered on a public repository on GitHub. This was how we became aware of this breach and discovered that the GitHub user ([private]) had published our entire mobile application codebase on their public repository. We never hired or contracted with [private] and do not know how he gained unauthorized access to all our code.

The ongoing public access of our code on GitHub posses significant risk and damage to our business and the security of users on our app.

We are requesting that GitHub immediately delete this repository (https://github.com/borisslavko/Clover-iOS) and all copies made for our code.

Thank you,
