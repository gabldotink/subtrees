Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The java file to be reported is a copyrighted work owned by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, to which I belong, and was illegally taken out by the developer and leaked to Github.

Many Japanese media have reported this matter.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As I reported the other day, the original work is the files that make up the services within Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. Therefore, you cannot check the service from the outside.
However, the first line of the java file to be reported this time has a description indicating that it is a package owned by SMBC (Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Many engineers around the world have forked repositories containing compromised java files.
It takes a lot of effort to check each forked file. Please, stop the entire fork of the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

They violate the license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please delete the target file and fork information because they are copyrighted works that are prohibited from being taken out of the company.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
