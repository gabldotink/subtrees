**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] and [private] at Papa John's International, Inc. We have discovered that the source code for our applications are being hosted on GitHub; we own these copyright-protected works. Further, we found passwords and URLs that are on GitHub as well.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Source code for our applications, passwords, and URLs that are copyright-protected or trade secrets: https://github.com/n-shan-hcl/papajohns_backup

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take everything on this and associated with this URL down:  
https://github.com/n-shan-hcl/papajohns_backup

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

To the best of our knowledge, there are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, this is our proprietary and copyrighted-protected work.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please take it down.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we do not. Our contractor was searching for it, but has not been able to identify the exact person. If you are able to tell the username, we would appreciate knowing it. We believe it is an employee for our contractor.
