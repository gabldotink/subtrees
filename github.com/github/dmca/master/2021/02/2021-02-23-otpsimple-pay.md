**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Because several of our partners violated the original license terms (sold as their own product, under their own name), we withdrew it from Github and are no longer open-source. Some users have been reached to cancel the repo, while others have not, and these versions are still available and violate our terms.
