These are school projects from the course EECS 482 at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. Initially, the repo was made public when there was a limit to the number of private repositories. I was then asked by my professor of the course to make private, so that students of the course could not use my work as a solution. This was done several years ago, but the repo was allegedly cloned prior to this.

My repository: [private]  
The cloned repository: https://github.com/joininggithubnow/os-projects

No, they are not licensed under an open source license.
