RE: REMOVAL OF PRIVATE SOURCE CODE REQUEST

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This repository is from our internal source control system and was leaked by a contractor: https://github.com/ajcarlos032/therms-mobile. This repository contains sensitive information such as NPM registry token for a user in our organization as well as the source code to our mobile app. I am requesting that this repository be removed from GitHub.com. 

The Github user profile owner needs to remove and destroy the source code from the above referenced Github url immediately.

I do not have contact information for this Github profile nor do we know who the exact source of the profile owner is. 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

V/R,
