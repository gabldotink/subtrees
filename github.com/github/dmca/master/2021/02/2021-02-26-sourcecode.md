We have discovered that some of our proprietary code was stolen and is published on Github.com at such locations:

1. https://github.com/ForexTesterProject - ALL the repositories here including https://github.com/ForexTesterProject/forex-tester, https://github.com/ForexTesterProject/Forex-Tester-back, and https://github.com/ForexTesterProject/Forex-Copier were stolen from our proprietary repositories either by an employee/contractor or by a hacker (we are still investigating the matter). The repositories contain the source code of [private], the product fully developed and owned by our company [private] and a prototype of our other product – [private]. Our websites are [private] and [private], if it is necessary, then we can prove the ownership of these websites.

2. https://github.com/rebider/4xDev-site - this is a source code of another website ([private]) that was developed by our team and which code is also proprietary and should be removed from GitHub immediately.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We cannot find any forks for now

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is NOT licensed under an open-source license. All the code is proprietory.

We have no doubts that our code is published on GitHub illegally. We do NOT license our code to others and the code should only be accessible by the employees and contractors who work for the company, so there is no way how this code may be published on GitHub legally.

ALL the published contents at the mentioned links cause a copyright infringement and should be completely removed from GitHub immediately.
