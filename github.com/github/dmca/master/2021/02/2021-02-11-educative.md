**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am the company's piracy investigator and have been given responsibility to take down copyright infringement of our content on the behalf of Fahim Ul Haq.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

This is our educative course: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  

https://github.com/lei-hsia/grokking-system-design/find/master

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I have reviewed a representative sample of the forked repositories and conclude that the following members within this network are allegedly infringing on our content.  https://github.com/lei-hsia/grokking-system-design/network/members

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

This is in violation of our Terms of Service, as we do not allow people to download our content. Please see our terms here:

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

The best solution would be to remove the entire repository from every person that has forked the content. This is a violation of our Terms and we do not allow the downloading of our content in any way.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
