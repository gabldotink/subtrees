**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the member of the CS61B course staff in charge of taking down online solutions of previous semesters.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am writing on behalf of the creator and owner of one or more copyrighted works appearing on your web site, which can be found on https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa17/index.html. Under the Project collaboration policy, students are not allowed to share skeleton code and/or their solutions publicly on github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Repositories:  
https://github.com/danjkim/CS61B/tree/master/proj0  
https://github.com/loisbho/cs61b/tree/master/proj0

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched for forks of the repositories and have included them in the URLs in the question above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

As a department, we own not just the skeleton files but the solutions themselves. The skeleton files, solutions, specifications, graders, and introductory material have all been authored by the department and are our sole property.

I am writing to you concerning the unauthorized reproduction, display or other use of those copyrighted works on the site. The author of this material has not granted permission or license for you to post or otherwise use those materials.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository must be made private. Another acceptable solution is deleting the repository

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
