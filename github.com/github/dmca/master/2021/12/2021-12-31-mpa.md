Dear GitHub,

 

We’re writing to call you attention to, and ask your assistance with, exploits of the Digital Rights Management software Widevine that are being hosted on and distributed from repositories on your platform.  In short, the poster has written scripts to circumvent DRM on multiple streaming platforms, including Disney+, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and others.  These scripts allow users to rip (download) streams directly to their devices, and, then, distribute them on the internet.  This is as clear a violation of the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions as we’ve seen (17 USC 1201 et seq.), and the result is infringement of our Member Studios’ (and others’) copyrights, by unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and/or public performance.  Accordingly, we’ve alerted the owner of Widevine (Google) to this issue, and are also asking you to remove the repositories containing these scripts, specifically:

 

Netflix: https://github.com/widevinedump/NETFLIX-DL-6.1.0, https://github.com/widevinedump/Netflix-4K-Script, https://github.com/widevinedump/Netflix-videos-downloader  
Paramount+: https://github.com/widevinedump/Paramount-Plus-4k-Downloader  
Disney+: https://github.com/widevinedump/DISNEY-4K-SCRIPT  
Google Play: https://github.com/widevinedump/Gplay-4k-Downloader
 

Widevine is proprietary software that prevents stream ripping, and the scripts circumvent that by exploiting a vulnerability to allow stream ripping, including as specifically listed as follows and as evidenced by the poster’s statements of the scripts’ purpose and operation:


DISNEY-4K-SCRIPT  
disneyplus.py is the script that calls the decryption module  
pywidevine/decrypt/wvdecrypt.py is the script used to circumvent the DRM  
pywidevine/cdm/cdm.py and pywidevine/cdm/deviceconfig.py are used to configure the device and key information needed to decrypt the content

Gplay-4k-Downloader  
movie.py is the script that calls the decryption module  
pywidevine/decrypt/wvdecrypt.py is the script used to circumvent the DRM  
pywidevine/cdm/cdm.py and pywidevine/cdm/deviceconfig.py are used to configure the device and key information needed to decrypt the content

Netflix-4K-Script  
netflix.py is the main script  
pywidevine/clients/netflix/client.py, pywidevine/clients/netflix/config.py, and pywidevine/clients/netflix/profiles.py are used to configure the device and key information needed to decrypt the content  
Note that pywidevine/clients/netflix/config.py lists 3 actual Netflix accounts with their usernames and passwords  
pywidevine/downloader/wvdownloader.py is the script that calls the decryption module  
pywidevine/decrypt/wvdecrypt.py is the script used to circumvent the DRM

services/netflix.py is the script that calls the decryption module  
pywidevine/decrypt/wvdecryptcustom.py is the script used to circumvent the DRM  
pywidevine/cdm/cdm.py and pywidevine/cdm/deviceconfig.py are used to configure the device and key information needed to decrypt the content

Paramount-Plus-4k  
paramountplus.py is the main script  
pywidevine/clients/paramountplus/config.py and pywidevine/clients/paramountplus/downloader.py are used to configure the device and key information needed to decrypt the content and circumvent the DRM
