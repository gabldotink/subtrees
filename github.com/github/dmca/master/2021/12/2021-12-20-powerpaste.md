**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private], [private], Ephox Corporation dba Tiny Technologies, Inc. I am authorized to act on behalf of Tiny Technologies Inc. to seek remove of copyrighted code that is currently being distributed publicly on Github.

Tiny Technologies Inc. is the original source code owner of PowerPaste

The source code is private and owned by Tiny Technologies Inc., the source code is in our private repository located [private]

The copyrighted code that is currently being distributed and forked on Github are compiled and minified javascript versions of the original source code which is made available to our subscribers under a commercial license. There are no open source elements to PowerPaste

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work is a commercial product called PowerPaste, it's a javascript plugin that runs in a browser and improves the quality of content copied and pasted into a rich text editor.

PowerPaste is a commercial product, only paid users have access to the plugin and covered under a commercial license that does not allow for this kind of distribution.

The PowerPaste product information page is located here [https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/powerpaste/](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/powerpaste/), it clearly states its available via subscription only. The details of the license are detailed here in section 2.1

[https://www.tiny.cloud/legal/tiny-self-hosted-oem-saas-agreement](https://www.tiny.cloud/legal/tiny-self-hosted-oem-saas-agreement)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository [https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste](https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste) should be removed including the forks.

The repository includes 2 versions of PowerPaste. The source code is in its minified state with the original license header still attached and is being publicly distributed which violates Tiny Technologies Incorporated's terms of service.

The known forks are listed here: [https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/network/members](https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/network/members)

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The compiled source code for PowerPaste can be accessed via subscription. The subscription provides a valid API key that can be used to consume the code via our cloud distribution channel. Alternatively, the subscriber can download the code after logging into the account area [https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/](https://www.tiny.cloud/auth/login/)

The terms of use policy forbid re-distributing the source code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project has made the source code publicly available on GitHub, this bypasses our license and measures taken to keep the code available to subscribers described above.

In addition, the code can also be forked by the public which also bypasses our protection measures.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have checked all the forks from this project [https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/network/members](https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/network/members)

They appear to be a direct duplicate of the original posting from

[https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/](https://github.com/fangcw/tinymce_powerpaste/) without change.

Tiny Technologies Inc. would like all forks from this project to be taken down and removed from Github, we do not want the forks to be converted to a private repository.

There is no open source component to PowerPaste, its all proprietary code belonging to Tiny Technologies Inc.
