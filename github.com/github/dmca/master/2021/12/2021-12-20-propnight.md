**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] of MYTONA PTE.LTD., the publisher of “PROPNIGHT” game.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I represent MYTONA PTE. LTD. (“MYTONA” or “we”) a reputable and popular software app development company, a publisher of the “PROPNIGHT” game, see, for example,

- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549180/Propnight/

The developer of the “PROPNIGHT” game is Fntastic LLC. (“Fntastic”) and MYTONA is official representative of the developer.

It has come to MYTONA’S attention that GITHub https://github.com/xnf4o/PROPNIGHT_SDK_103 places the reverse-engineering code of the PROPNIGHT game by open source license. The site’s unauthorized use of our reverse-engineering code, constitutes copyright infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition, and an unfair and deceptive trade practice under the laws of the U.S., the E.U., and other countries.

Consequently, MYTONA demands that GITHub immediately and permanently cease and refrain from using PROPNIGHT’s reverse-engineering code, and removing any reference to PROPNIGHT from all your webpages and all other forms of media, including but not limited to social media.

To resolve this matter, you must confirm to us in writing by 22 December 2021, that GITHub has complied with the foregoing demand.

We note in the event that you fail to immediately remove, cease and refrain from using PROPNIGHT, MYTONA reserves the right to proceed with any acts necessary in the enforcement of the said demands without further notice to you.

We look forward to your prompt response.
