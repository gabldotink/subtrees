It has come to our attention that material from the Myers-Briggs® assessment has been posted https://christinahh.github.io/Dimensions/. The infringing material is the list of “Official” questions in the Myers-Briggs section of the page, beginning with “[private]” and ending with “[private]” Our material is not publicly available online.

I have a good-faith belief that this use of our material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

We were unable to find contact information for christinahh, the owner of this page. Our request, in accordance with our rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is that all “Official” Myers-Briggs questions be removed from this page. If that is not possible, we ask that the entire page be removed.
