**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am reporting the content that was originally created for Microsoft a long time ago, and on behalf of the current ownership holder of the work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyright protected work here is the full and authentic original source code of the commercial video game title Microsoft Urban Assault, which was developed by the German company Terratools and published by Microsoft in 1998.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Assault

The original copyrighted content was initially posted at the following link, after a successful legal contract between the original ownership holder and the current ownership holder:  
https://hiddenpalace.org/Urban_Assault_(Aug_17,_1998_prototype_with_source_code)

This file was directly uploaded by the current ownership holder at the above website, and it was only meant to be distributed at this website alone. This file contains the original source code within the Visual Source Safe package, which is still fully copyright protected.

The source code in this VSS repository was written by a programmer called [private] 23 years ago. His name can still be found inside the repository. Recently, I've come across a GitHub repository that illegally re-distributes this original source code from the VSS package without any permission from the author or the ownership holder.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The GitHub repository that contains the copyright infringement material can be found at here:  
https://github.com/SgtHannah/YPAGIT

The author (SgtHannah) of this repository simply stole the content of the original source code, and uploaded it on GitHub without any legal permission.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, the above repository that violates the copyright has one fork created by another person, which can be found at here:  
https://github.com/rodrigobmg/YPAGIT

Along with the original repository, this fork (or any other new forks that may have been created later) must be removed from the website as well. There is no difference between these two repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the source code and relevant assets were all written by [private] under the copyright of Microsoft back in the 90s, and it is still the legally protected content. Distributing this content at any other website (including GitHub) is in strict violation of the protected license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since it is plainly clear that that this repository was neither created under the original author's permission, nor the uploader has any legitimacy to re-distribute such copyrighted works publicly, the only acceptable solution for this violation is completely taking down the repository and forks from GitHub.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Here is the email address of the person who created this repository:
[private]

I have already contacted the person before taking action, and they did not respond to my message for more than several weeks. That was enough time for me to wait no more and take action against it.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair (https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22%22%3Efair) use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide (https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/%22%3EGuide) to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
