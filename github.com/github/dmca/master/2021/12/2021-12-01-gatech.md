I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
The copyrighted work that has been infringed includes all of the files provided for
multiple projects from the CS7638 course. Large portions of the files are direct copies
of the code provided to students to start the project. (Note that we are not claiming
copyright on code added to our original files.) Many of these files retain our copyright
notice at the top of the file.

The specific infringing files are located at:  
https://github.com/cancandan/robotics_ai_cs7638

I are claiming copyright infringement for every file in the repository marked with our
copyright notice at the top:

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I am asking that the robotics_ai_cs7638 repository be made private. These files can be
found by students in the current course, who may in a moment of weakness choose to
copy them and submit it as their own work, a violation of the GaTech Academic Honor
Code. By removing access to this material, you will remove the temptation for current
students to violate the honor code, and prevent yourself from being inadvertently drawn
into an Office of Student Integrity investigation.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is
accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf
of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,
