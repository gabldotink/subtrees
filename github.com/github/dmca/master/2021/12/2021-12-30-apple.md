Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,

 

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

 

[1]        I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, specifically section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

[3]        The copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed is Apple’s proprietary “iBoot” source code, which is responsible for ensuring trusted boot operation of Apple’s iOS software, includes Apple’s copyright notice, and is not open source.

 

[4]        I have a good faith belief that the content below is unlawful under these laws because, among other things, it reproduces Apple’s copyrighted software without authorization and in violation of Apple’s exclusive rights.

 

[5]        Reason:

Content Type:            Software

Violation(s):               Copyright Infringement

 

[6]        The repositories listed below infringe Apple’s rights in their entirety, and there is no non-infringing content therein. Accordingly, please act expeditiously to remove the repositories found at the following URLs:

As well as the following forks:

https://github.com/saddam1999/iBoot-newer

 

[7]        I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

 

[8]        I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

[9]        I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

[10]      I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice (https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/).

 

Thank you for your kind assistance.

 

Truthfully,
