https://github.com/LEGEND-LX/Dark-Fusion

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

AGPL-3.0 License

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Missing attributes, modified copyright headers, and a mere replacing of TeamUltroid and Ultroid to something of their own is what is being done in the above mentioned repositories.

Neither are the owners given their authorship nor are the commits preserved, as stated in the license.

Also, according to AGPL, "To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, **other than the making of an exact copy.** The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work." - the repositories in violation are an exact copy of our codes, with nothing added or removed, other than our copyright header, and name.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repositories must either be deleted, or made private as soon as possible.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
