While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Mars Research, Inc is the owner of this code and have been using it for over 3 years now. We needed some updates (Ruby on Rails) to the application and hired and outside developer. I reached out to the development and they can not find the offending party so we had to take it upon our self to handle this issue.

Please remove this the code from the site.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is code that we had developed and in the last few days our code was pushed up to this Github account with no security. We do not know who this is.

Thankfully [private] caught the code quickly as it had security information embedded in the code. We have changed all our security information but this code should not be public.

https://github.com/hdr105/pacific

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

None of this should be posted.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The code was available only to the developer on a secure accessible site. What they did I have no control over.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

I am assuming our developer did not take the same precaution with our code which caused this breach.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Anything related to this code should be taken down.

Thank YOu

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No we do not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
