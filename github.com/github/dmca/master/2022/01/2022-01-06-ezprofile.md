**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private] and I am the [private] of ezProfile which is a copyright-protected work.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[ezProfile](https://github.com/arifszn/ezprofile) is licensed under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/arifszn/ezprofile/blob/main/LICENSE). Another person stole my work removing license and copyright notice and impersonated that he is the creator of the original work. Which strictly violates the original work's copyright license and infringes my rights. I have tried to contact him nicely by creating an issue on the stolen github repo. But he refused to comply with it and removed the issue.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[https://github.com/0x1381/info](https://github.com/0x1381/info)

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="[https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints](https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology%22%3EComplaints)  about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="[https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have](https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork%22%3EHave)  you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, the alleged copy is not forked.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/arifszn/ezprofile/blob/main/LICENSE)

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The alleged copy has broken the following terms.
- **4A:** The copy is reuploaded and [license](https://github.com/0x1381/info/blob/main/LICENSE) in it states in line 189 `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]`. That is not meeting the requirement of the open-source license Apache License 2.0 as it states
> You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License
- **4C:** Attribution is removed in the alleged copy. The required attribution is found [here](https://github.com/arifszn/ezprofile/blob/main/src/App.js) on line 167. The License states that
> You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works

Ultimately, no mention of the original work's existence is present on the stolen copy.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Providing original license, adding attribution.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Github Profile:  [https://github.com/0x1381](https://github.com/0x1381)

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="[https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22%22%3Efair)  use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="[https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide](https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/%22%3EGuide)  to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
