We represent KIN, Inc. and related entities (collectively, “Kohl’s”), the companies behind the well-known Kohl’s department stores.

For more than fifty years, our client has operated a retail department store under the trade name KOHL’ S and has been using KOHL’ S as a trademark in connection with numerous goods and services, including the sale of clothing, jewelry, luggage, furniture, home décor, appliances, electronics, and toys, to name but a few categories. Kohl’s currently operates over 1,100 stores throughout the United States, as well as operating the retail website www.kohls.com. As a result of our client’ s investment of time, effort and resources to promote its KOHL’ S mark and the goods and services offered thereunder, the mark has become exclusively associated with our client and has built up enormous goodwill in the marketplace.

Kohl's owns the copyright in its www.kohls.com website and all content that appears at the site.

In addition to its copyright in the www.kohls.com website, Kohl's also owns trademark rights established in the KOHL’S mark through many years of use and promotion, Kohl’s owns multiple trademark registrations and applications for the mark KOHL’S, including U.S. Reg. Nos. 1772009 and 2047904 (collectively the “Marks”).
