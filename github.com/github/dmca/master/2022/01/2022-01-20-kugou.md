**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

No

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Our company, Guangzhou Kugou Computing Technology Co., Ltd., is the copyright owner of "Kugou music" software. Kugou music is one of the most famous music app all over the world. I am the in-house legal counsel of Kugou Music and have the right to act on behalf of Kugou music.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Kugou music is a music app that provides millions of copyrighted musical works to the users. Kugou music has been lisenced the copyright of communication through information network of those musical works from the copyright owner and has the right to take action against all copyright infringers. The URL of Kugou music: https://www.kugou.com/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Title of the file: unlock-music

Repository URL: https://github.com/unlock-music/unlock-music

All existing forks of the repository: https://github.com/unlock-music/unlock-music/network/members

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

Thus, we confirm that we file complaints against the parent repository as well as all forks of https://github.com/unlock-music.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Kugou music has encrypted a large number of musical works in the platform. Under encryption, those musical works can only be played in Kugou music by users that have obtained the membership of Kugou music. These measures are taken for protecting the copyrighted works in case they are misused or copied in the network without the authorization of copyright owner.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused code is for circumventing the encryption by altering the format of the musical works. Under encryption, the format of copyrighted musical works is KGM or KGMA. The code can change the format into MP3 or FLAT so that the unencrypted music can be played through any media without obtaining the membership of Kugou music. Netease (another online music platform) has requested such take-down and the code has removed the Netease part. The infringement is obvious.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?
