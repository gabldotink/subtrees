**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. GitHub posted material is a collection of assignment solutions dependent on starter code provided by me, for which I hold the copyright. Posting such material is also in beach of university academic integrity policy.

Example of posted files containing my copyright notice: 

https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Assignment1/merge.h

https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Assignment5/fileman.c


Further to your response, additional files with my copyright notice in them  
https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Lab1/pintos/src/threads/thread.c

https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Lab2/pintos/src/threads/thread.c

https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Lab2/pintos/src/threads/lock.c

https://github.com/allrigin0/CSE130/blob/master/Lab2/pintos/src/threads/semaphore.c

Might I suggest it would be too complex to simple request removal of only those files with my copyright notice in them and simply have the repo made private.
