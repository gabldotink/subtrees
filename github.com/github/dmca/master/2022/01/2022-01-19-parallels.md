Dear Sirs,

We are Corporation Service Company (CSC), a leading provider of brand protection and internet monitoring services. We have been authorised by our client, Corel Corporation and its subsidiaries (hereafter “Corel”), to take action in relation to internet matters that infringe their Intellectual Property Rights (“IPR”) and online reputation.

Our client is a well-known Canadian software company specialising in graphics processing. It is known for producing software titles such as CorelDRAW, and for acquiring brands such as Parallels, AfterShot Pro, PaintShop Pro, Painter, Video Studio, and WordPerfect.

It was brought to our attention that one of your users on your platform is offering for download a cracked version of the Parallels Desktop software together with instruction on how to bypass software trial period. The illegal download utilises our client’s copyright without any authorisation; and, our client confirms that the offering of a download of the software is not in any way authorised.

We therefore would appreciate your cooperation in removing the download page for the software (listed below) on the basis of infringement of our client’s IPR Based on the representative number of forks we have reviewed, we believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository (listed below).
