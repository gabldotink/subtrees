**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We own copy righted material. A sub-contractor said if we did not pay him via PayPal, he would post confidential code. He had signed an independent contractor's agreement, which included a non-disclosure. We have all these threats and the independent contractor's agreement documented.  
On Friday, Feb. 11th, a DMCA takedown was issued for the original post. See request #1499901. The user simply ignored this takedown and re-posted the code under a different repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Description: Source code  
Location: https://github.com/herobobparr/Ortho_Source

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository needs to be blocked.  
https://github.com/herobobparr/Ortho_Source

Given that this is the 2nd time the user has done this, we also ask that his account be suspended. A separate harassment complaint was filed under #1499872.
