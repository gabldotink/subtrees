The project in question was originally a resource for a Grand Theft Auto V modification called FiveM.

I own a private github repo with code I wrote some month ago with a full "server" core.  
It seems to have leaked and have been reposted by these developers on Github.  
I'm the original writer of this code as you can see by the full commit history and date of the commits. (Their repo don't contains the full commit history, only a "full upload" commit)

All the code present in my repository is deposited under French Copyright Law.

You can find a full copy of my original work at this private link : [private] (This link is not meant to be published publicly after this DMCA request)

I can describe my content as +1200 Lua files from 2 years of work. (Original resources names (folders) are for example : fb_accessories, fb_emotes, fb_hookah, fb_shops, fl_animals)
