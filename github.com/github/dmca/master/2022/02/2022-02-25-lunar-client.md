This firm represents Moonsworth LLC (hereinafter “Moonsworth”). Moonsworth is the creator and owner of the downloadable software known as “Lunar Client”.1 Your platform, located at https://github.com, hosts content that is actively infringing upon my client’s copyrights.
Moonsworth is the copyright owner of the underlying source code of Lunar Client as well as all designs and artwork associated therewith. The infringing works, which appear on the repository located at https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-client-qt and https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-client-agents , are unauthorized copies of my client’s original copyrighted works or are substantially similar to my client’s works.  
The right to prepare derivative works based upon the original, copyrighted work is one of the express rights afforded to copyright owners by U.S. Copyright law. See 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). Our client’s exclusive right to prepare derivative works based upon the original Lunar Client, however, is being infringed upon by distribution of materials on the repository by GitHub users.  
When used pursuant to this direction, implementation of the codes contained in the repository result in the modification of the Lunar Client content and its features. The resulting product is a new, derivative work which incorporates a majority of my client’s original, copyrighted source code. See, e.g., Micro Star v. Formgen Inc., 154 F.3d 1107 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that CDs containing code which modified the video game “Duke Nukem” were unauthorized derivative works and, therefore, copyright infringement). The creation of such derivative work without my client’s express authorization is a violation of my client’s copyright rights.  
All correspondence regarding this matter, on behalf of the copyright owners, should be directed to our offices as follows:
