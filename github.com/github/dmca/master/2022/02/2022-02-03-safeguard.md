**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I created and developed the authentication software safeguard.gg which is now discontinued, though still my copyrights still stand for my code which has been stolen.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A majority of the instances of my code being stolen have already been removed as seen here https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/01/2022-01-31-safeguard.md, though one repo has been re-uploaded, and the other repos I didn't include in my initial report.

My authentication software safeguard.gg was breached last year and they leaked my personal information, source code, and database. Here's an archive displaying that [private][private]  

Then this other software I don't own and didn't allow to use my code, auth.gg, stole my code and are using for their authentication. In specific, they stole my c# code and made a GitHub repository containing it. Here is the link to my c# code, Pastebin will have to suffice since I've discontinued my software [private]

First, compare line 1224 of Pastebin to https://github.com/codermoth/csharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/Auth.GG%20Example/API.cs#L972. Aside from auth.gg removing the using statements from my code, it's the exact same. The reason they're using the same encryption is because the server side code isn't theirs either. It's stolen from me too, which will be become more evident as you see how much he stole from me. Now, if you look at line 922 of Pastebin and compare to https://github.com/codermoth/csharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/Auth.GG%20Example/API.cs#L855 you will see they stole code here too. My class is Security, and my function is StartSession. Their class is Security and their function is Start. The code is also almost identical, once again proving my point.

Also please compare my code at line 124 of Pastebin to their code https://github.com/codermoth/csharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/Auth.GG%20Example/API.cs#L171. It's evident they stole this from me too. Nobody handles responses like this, I don't even do it like that anymore. Delimiting data with an upright slash is impractical when JSON exists. Lastly they're also stealing my variable and function names. One example you can find is comparing line 32 of Pastebin, and https://github.com/codermoth/csharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/Auth.GG%20Example/API.cs#L63. Another example you can find is comparing line 514 of Pastebin to https://github.com/codermoth/csharp/blob/main/Console%20Example/Auth.GG%20Example/API.cs#L354. Considering all of this, I believe it's very obvious they stole my code. I would like all the repos I've listed in the below fields removed and if possible, I would like you to blacklist my code so it can't be uploaded again. Thank you for your time.

No

No forks currently.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Their email on website is contact@auth.gg though they're ignoring me I'm pretty sure because I have emailed them multiple times before and it goes through but I get no response.
