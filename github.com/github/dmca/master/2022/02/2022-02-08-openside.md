Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, we did not search for any existing forks, but it is good to mention that this repo (batcomodules) was disabled due to our earlier requests, and the user "helpthenation" has already reactivated it once again! And this time has exposed more of our apps' source codes to the public repo. Also, it is good to mention that this is the third time we are submitting a takedown request for this user.
