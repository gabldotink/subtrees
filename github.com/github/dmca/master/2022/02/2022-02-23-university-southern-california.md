**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I ([private]) am the copyright owner and [private] of the code as outlined in my description below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is starter code / template code that is written entirely by me and used in the [private] course at the University of Southern California. Some of the files contain the following notice:  
// [private]  
// [private]

This starter code is not publicly available, but you can see an example of the current version of the starter code in the following private GitHub repository: ([private]. Other than the "Libraries" directory, I am the copyright owner of the code. As you can see, there is a significant amount of copyrighted code in several of the directories. For example, the "([private]" directory contains approximately 30 source files of which I am the copyrighted owner.

If you are not able to view the private repository, some examples of the files that are largely or almost entirely written by me are: Math.h/cpp, Component.h/cpp, Actor.h, Random.h/cpp, Font.h/cpp, LevelLoaded.h/cpp, Mesh.h/cpp, Renderer.h/cpp, SegmentCast.h/cpp, Shader.h/cpp, Texture.h/cpp, and VertexArray.h/cpp. Many other files will contain a mix of my copyrighted code and student's original code.

Although the students do write their own original code in the implementation of the assignments, that code is not easily severable from the significant amount of template code for which I hold the copyright. I am fine with students maintaining these repositories/copies of their code privately for their own reference, but public access is problematic both because of its copyright violation and separately, academic integrity concerns.

I have attempted to contact students whose repos I've discovered, but the I was not successfully able to make contact with the users listed in the next section.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
