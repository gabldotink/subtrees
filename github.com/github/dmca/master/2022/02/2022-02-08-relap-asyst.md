Our Company owns RELAP and ASYST software for analyzing the flow of fluid through pipes for nuclear power. Our software was placed on Github for the sole purpose of having somewhere to have a backup and to allow our coders access to it. We did not know that the repository was made public, it was supposed to be private. This software is regulated by the DOE in Washington D.C. and these users that have taken the software can be taken to court by the federal government if it gets reported to them as well as us.
