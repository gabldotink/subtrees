Original works: https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs  
Infringed content: https://github.com/nenge123/emulatorjs

I opened an issue here (https://github.com/nenge123/emulatorjs/issues/1) asking them to state changes and he said "no". He claims to have downloaded the code from here ([private]) but when looking at his code there are several features that I implemented that are not in the emulator.js file the claims to have downloaded. For example, localization and screen recording. He has also been opening several problems within my repository showing that he does still depend on the code.

He claims that it is not from my licence because I divided the main javascript file, while he still has it in 1 file.

He has modified versions of the core emulator files. (https://github.com/nenge123/emulatorjs/tree/master/cores)

Looking though his code, he obviously uses an older version of my repository, but seems to watch the changes I make. One change I made recently fixed some mobile problems.

Original code location: https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs/blob/main/data/emu-main.js on line 1107
Copied code: https://github.com/nenge123/emulatorjs/blob/master/emulator.js on line 14718

He obviously has copied the code, but claims to not have ever used code from my repository.
