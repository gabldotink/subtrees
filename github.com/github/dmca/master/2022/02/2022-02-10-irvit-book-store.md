Dear Sirs,

Our client, Ivrit Book Store 2020 Ltd, the leading digital books publisher and distributor in Israel has filed a lawsuit (CV 56576-06-21)against a developer of a code which is being used to break the encryption of the e-books of our client (DRM).

The said defendant was working with others to develop the code on GitHub platform.

https://github.com/zofit

https://github.com/zofit/Loazit2

They have also developed code to retrieve all metadata from the e-book in order to make short descriptions of the books on illegal distribution platforms like Telegram.

We wish to ask you to remove these developing groups and block their access to GitHub platform due to infringement of terms of use (Part D s.2) and according to (Part L S.3) of the terms. We would also ask you to provide us with all information and contact details of the developers who are part of this development.

Looking forward to your urgent reply.

Sincerely yours,

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

this DMCA notice is not based on infringment of our client's code but refers to a code on GitHub which was created to infring our clients copyright in their e-books.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/zofit

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our client’s (e-vrit) native application is a book reader app (similar to Amazon Kindle) that let the user who purchased books via their site, to read them in the app.
any book that is available on the app is not accessible in the file system and as well is encrypted with sha-256 keys and decrypt using the app it self.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This GitHub project uses reverse engineering to get the access to the hardcoded part of the encryption that’s inside the native app compiled code and as well abusing the client’s API calls to get the books
this project lets the users get their own books that they have purchased or using other people username and password and get the books bytes from our API and then save them to local disk and after that using that information about the encryption to decrypt the books and finally people illegally are using this tool to upload the decrypted books to telegram and other platforms that share unauthorized copyrighted materials
 

I hope this is clear enough, you can also see that the description of the GitHub project is e-vrit DRM removal – as you know DRMs are meant to protect copyright material and their removal can’t be for legal matters.
