The code was originally created by myself and published under no license, only abiding by Github Terms of Service.

The original work used to live in [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files under https://github.com/mrTownsend/mrTownsend-Cogs/tree/main/antibot  
https://github.com/mrTownsend/mrTownsend-Cogs/blob/main/statistics-zip.axx  
https://github.com/mrTownsend/mrTownsend-Cogs/tree/a4d7f12a27d74faef495e468f809d5cd70b049fe/botstats  

Every single commit containing botstats, antibot, statistics-zip.axx and should be removed as this is modified unlicensed code this includes any releases i.e https://github.com/mrTownsend/mrTownsend-Cogs/releases containing any of the above as distribution is not authorized as the initial approach was met with resistance and refusal to comply with my requests.

The user also claimed he will continue to breach in private https://github.com/mrTownsend/mrTownsend-Cogs/issues/10#issuecomment-1026178585, which means I also want to ensure that any private copies which he has are also taken down, given the nature of the unlicensed work.

The user is also in breach of multiple other licenses, not all are related to my work but is the work of colleagues and friends which he downloaded and uploaded under his own name claiming himself to be the owner.

Here is a list of the existing breaches and the link to the original code source, the following does not breach my copyright ownership but is here to enforce the point in which I believe action should be taken on this users account and repo to ensure he is no longer in breach of so many different licenses
