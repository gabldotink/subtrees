**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am attorney in fact representing Prosper Funding LLC and Prosper Marketplace Inc. ("Prosper")

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Prosper has an instance where an unauthorized contractor copied code from several private Github repos and posted them publicly on Github. The repositories includes proprietary code. These public repos should be taken down ASAP. The corresponding Prosper internal repository URLs are:

[private]  
[private]  
[private]  
[private]  
[private]  
[private]  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Below are the unauthorized cloned public repositories hosted on Github, where the hosted content is a direct, literal copy of Prosper's work. Specifically, these URLs need to be taken down:

https://github.com/llui2222/platform-listings  
https://github.com/llui2222/web-graphql  
https://github.com/llui2222/web-hub-borrower  
https://github.com/llui2222/web-borrower  
https://github.com/llui2222/svc-personal-loan-offers  
https://github.com/llui2222/svc-personal-loan-application

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The copies are a direct copy of the various internal Prosper repositories (listed above), so all forks should also be taken down.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
