Hi there

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

An account holder in GitHub has literally copied all problem statements from our paid course material and made them public under his  GitHub account. 

https://github.com/Vivek1898/Codetantra-Programming-In-Java-Solution/

I am the [private] of CodeTantra, an EdTech startup which offers online coding courses for a fee.
 
The person who has access to our paid content has provided all our coding exercises as they are in our online course. He has even stated the exact lesson numbers, question numbers - and you will also notice he clearly states that they are from CodeTantra.

We came to know about this when we received complaints from our other paid customers that our content is being shared openly on GITHub. 

We request you to take immediate action and also inform the account holder that it is in violation of terms and conditions of GitHub.

We do not have the contact information of the Infrenger  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Kindly do the needful at the earliest.
