The text of the refereed license is:
(Here translated to english for your convenience)
Practical Educational Project License (LPEP).

Objective: TO preserve the educational usefulness of certain practical works proposed to students and protect the investment and effort dedicated to their preparation by teachers, avoiding the total or partial dissemination of the solution given by the students to them, maintaining the authorship and intellectual property over them.

Applicability: This License is applicable to fully teacher-designed projects, where the student need only complete the provided implementation for the design requirements to be satisfied. The student in no case can be considered the sole author of the solution, in any case partial co-author, and cannot be considered the holder of the sole intellectual property over it.
This License is not applicable to proposals for works or projects with free content or format, of whose execution the students are logically the sole authors and therefore the holders of the intellectual property. It is not intended in any way to violate this recognized right.

Ownership: The sole intellectual author of this Practical Educational Project is the teacher. Of the original idea, the subsequent design of the project, its statement based on functional requirements specification, the automatic correction system used for its evaluation and each of the tests associated with it, as well as the support software that It is given to the students as a starting point, guideline or support for the realization of the project.

Rights: The author reserves all rights. By making the material associated with the project available to the student, the teacher does not waive in any way the intellectual property of his/her work, nor does it become free or in the public domain. Quite the contrary, the teacher allows the student to carry out the project (whose solution will be considered a collaborative work) since this is precisely the ultimate educational objective for which it was created, but he expressly reserves all rights to his work, the realization of any other work derived from it is prohibited, and the redistribution, disclosure, publication, sharing or transfer, totaly or partialy by any means of any material delivered or derived from it is expressly prohibited, and especially the solution given by the student (which, being considered a collaborative work, requires the consent of all co-authors), given that its dissemination undermines the educational usefulness of this Practical Educational Project as it is an act of necessary cooperation in subsequent cases of plagiarism.
