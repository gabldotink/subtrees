**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS devices. We designed the launcher to be free and open-source so our users have the piece of mind when using it and to comply with the game’s EULA. Our work can be found here:

https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/Tungstend/HMCL-PE/tree/main/PojavLauncher

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks of this repository that I am aware of. However, since the issue involves the offender paywalling the .APK and forks do not do the same, they do not pose as much of a threat.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GNU Public License v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

A user, Tungstend, is violating the GPL-3 license by using PojavLauncherTeam code in their project, HMCL-PE, without a way to successfully compile the project, and offering a paid subscription to enter a testing ring for the said project.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The offender can either provide the necessary materials to compile the project on its own, or remove the infringed content from the application.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
