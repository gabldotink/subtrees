The code published at https://github.com/Swanchick/cstrike-1.6 is private and not for public publication. The original private repository can be found at [private]

About five months ago [private] terminated all relations with this developer due to his incompetence, but he did get access to some private repositories, and may have kept them to this day.

User who has published private code for public use was only a developer and had no right to publish the work in his own name, he could only publish on behalf of an organization with an agreement between the [private] of the organization and their developers.

Notified that I also contacted this user, but was refused to remove or hide the repository. The reason for the refusal has not been given.
