I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. The repository that was falsely taken down due to a DMCA claim is https://github.com/TheonlyIcebear/Bloxflip-Smart-Bet, The only file that relates to a "BloxFlip Rain Joiner" is in the Tools folder named AutoRain.py. I am the owner of the program and I did not use any of the person's code who claims to have made this code. Their program is private/closed source and I have no means of actually getting their source code especially since there is no actual github repository for their program. Not only this but their rain joiner is websocket based while mines using the python pyautogui module to function. The program the opposing party claims to have made is this file on my repository https://github.com/TheonlyIcebear/Bloxflip-Smart-Bet/tree/main/Tools/AutoRain.py so there is no reason why the entire repository should be deleted. Nor did they even code the program at all.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/TheonlyIcebear/Bloxflip-Smart-Bet

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Large peices of the code in the file come from [private] (They're not the creator of this DMCA takedown) but I do give [private] (The owner) credit in the program and the License ([private]) clearly states that anyone can use it for commercial use even with modification. Which is done in my program. Furthermore [private] goes on to use parts of my code in his own version ([private])

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
