**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] of Guangzhou Yuexin Technology Co., Ltd., mainly [private] of the [private] of China Inspection and Certification Group, link（ https://github.com/FengFind/company_rpcNew ）The project involved is part of the code of the system project developed by Guangzhou Yuexin Technology Co., Ltd. for China inspection group.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

1. Link（ https://github.com/FengFind/company_rpcNew ）The project involved is a system project developed by Guangzhou Yuexin Technology Co., Ltd. for China inspection group. It is a non open source project. The uploader uploads the company's non open source project to GitHub for sharing through illegal means without the permission of the company and customers. There is serious infringement. I hope to delete the relevant code immediately.  
2. There are official names and abbreviations of customers in the project. In the attack and defense penetration test exercise participated in by China Inspection Group, unauthorized projects exposed on the Internet belong to serious leakage of sensitive information, which will cause China inspection group to deduct points in the evaluation, thus affecting the ranking, even reputation and influence of the group.  
3. The project includes but is not limited to the actual IP address, user name, password, code framework and other sensitive information of China Inspection and Certification Group. The disclosure of the current project code on the Internet will lead to the direct exposure of the group's relevant systems to hackers, increasing the risk of the system being penetrated by hackers, which is a serious security risk.

Based on the above, we hope to delete the GitHub open project source code immediately（ https://github.com/FengFind/company_rpcNew ）In order to reduce the risk of relevant systems being breached, and we will retain the responsibility of disclosing the source code of the company's projects without permission.
