Sunnyvale is a server made up of content thieves. The same has had several content removed from [private] because of copyright and now that he's been receiving my DMCA he wants to argue that the content is theirs. [private] been doing commissions with these FILES since 2019 and [private] never had a refund or DMCA problem from anyone. Sunnyvale as a profiteer took these files from someone who made a commission with me and started to use as if they had made such content.  
  
The mentioned repository was hidden because it is not open to the public and because I opened a DMCA against them on [private] I had to keep it public so that [private] can compare the files and remove theirs from the platform. 2 DMCAs were released against them and Sunnyvale removed the mod before steam could decide on it. We clearly see the fear that I win the case and they get punished here.  
  
I will show some community photo about Sunnyvale

I would like to add that Sunnyvale LOST permission to monetize their server ([private]) because of copyright issues.  
Maybe this image will help too. You can clearly see that they abuse [private] DMCA system and have been punished.  
  
Sunnyvale is a known thief in the [private] community. He allows HACKERS to play on his server if they pay him well.
