**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work in Product Operations for Byteboard Inc, the creator of the content in question. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repositories in question include code from proprietary Byteboard Assessments used to evaluated technical skills on behalf of hiring companies. The individuals who posted these materials to GitHub were candidates who we invited to the interview and posted the materials online in contradiction of their agreement to "not share your code, text and other data or information that you create while using the Service with any other party." Beyond the material the candidates created, the repositories include code from the existing codebase that candidates are provided to work in that is also proprietary content. While we cannot link directly to the assessments because they are not publicly available, you can see our homepage (https://byteboard.dev/) and note that the repositories explicitly identify Byteboard in multiple locations. They were found during routine searches of GitHub for Byteboard material in order to identify leaked assessments.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
