**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] of South China University of Technology. Ownership of the source code is the [private]. I started an aircraft simulation project and submitted the source code to Github.com. I mistakenly uploaded some unauthorized code to this project address as well. After that, I made this source code a private repository for information security reasons. But someone else forked my source code. So the source code still exists in the Github system.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This source code is a simulation program developed by our team. Now it's in my [private]: [private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We need to remove all source code in project. The following URLs should be removed:  
https://github.com/true2019fans/Plan-D  
https://github.com/chengqian0210/Plan-D  
https://github.com/Rambo960516/Plan-D

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I searched and checked the links above (https://github.com/true2019fans/Plan-D, https://github.com/chengqian0210/Plan-D, https://github.com/Rambo960516/Plan-D).  
It is my source code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best possible solution would be to remove the content permanently.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we do not have the details

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
