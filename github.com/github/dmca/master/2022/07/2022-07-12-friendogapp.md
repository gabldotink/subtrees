**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I proceed to describe the complaint:  
Through the freelancer platform we hired a developer to continue with the development of the app. The app was already developed, this freelancer was hired to finalize small details.  
The relationship with the freelancer was good at the beginning, until she started asking us for more money for the work, when we refused to the freelancer's blackmails, she decided to upload the code to her github and make it public.  
This is the repository where this scammer has uploaded our code:  
https://github.com/dreamhigh0609/Friendog
As you can see she uploaded it a week ago. And if you can check our repository we have been developing the app for more than a year.  
Our real project is published here and is private:  
[private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This is the repository to which our code has been uploaded by this scammer and should be removed:  
https://github.com/dreamhigh0609/Friendog  
Evidently this freelancer no longer has access to the repository but he has the latest update on his local and this is what he has uploaded to his repository.
