**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] for the copyright holder (MIPI Alliance, Inc., a developer of global technical standards for mobile & mobile-influenced semiconductor interfaces and protocols). The copyright holder has asked me to submit this takedown notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[1] [private]  
[2] [private]  
[3] [private]  
[4] [private]  

Please note that in all four cases the repository is hosting the entire original copyright protected documents, not excerpts or derivative works.

Furthermore, the title of the repository is "mipi_alliance_docs", indicating an intention to distribute MIPI Alliance's documents (despite not having our authorization to do so).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
