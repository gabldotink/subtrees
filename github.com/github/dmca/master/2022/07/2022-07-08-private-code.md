No, and that it main issue here - [private] have lost the contact and therefore [private] not able to reach out to the user.  
The email address that is most likely linked to that github account is [private], but that email is not active anymore because it's bound to the project we used to work on. The user is not anymore working on that project.  
The user created the github account for the project and is probably not using it anymore = no visible activity in any of the repos.
