Hello Dear github:

I am a [private], it is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.
  
   I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DCMA Notice.

[private] used to be created a Repositry called "keda-server" in [private], which containes important keda company's source code. all contents are owned by the "苏州科达科技股份有限公司 ", Later found that before I deleted, the user named "[private]" completely forked entire Repository, and it still exists.  
    The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about out forked Repository:

https://github.com/github188/keda-server


Since upper Repository contains the company's source code, system configuration information and important algorithm, belong to the company's internal data assets, so i hope Github as soon as possible to helpus completely remove github188/keda-server and .... and thank you very much!
