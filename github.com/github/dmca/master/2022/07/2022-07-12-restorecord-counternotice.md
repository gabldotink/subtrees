I am [private] of the service RestoreCord. I authored the code seen here https://github.com/wnelson03/RestoreCord-Source-Code

Seven months ago, I sold the service RestoreCord and transferred the domain, database, code, all the assets to the new owner. However I never relinquished the copyrights of my code to him, I simply sent him the code and provided him no written transfer of the copyright rights.

So, this DMCA takedown is illegal. I have full rights to release the code [private] and never relinquished my rights over. And if you care about the motive, my motives stemmed from this owner turning out to be very unethical/illegal, and I was not pleased with this given the fact I'd entrusted him with my former users. So I did what I could legally, as I didn't want to do anything illegal as the claimant of this illegal DMCA has.

His illegal DMCA takedown is clearly rooted in anger and not evidence. He's upset that he was caught token logging discord accounts [private], he's upset that he was caught scamming [private], and he's upset that he was caught credit card frauding [private]

However he has no legal ownership over this code. He was simply sent it by me when he purchased the service. I still hold all copyright rights and am free to do whatever I please with my own copyrighted property. I request reversal of this illegal DMCA as quick as possible. Thank you for your time.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The material was not removed by mistake. It was intentionally removed with malice as the claimant is emotionally unstable and has troubles following the law.

He has no legal basis on which to claim my copyrighted property.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
