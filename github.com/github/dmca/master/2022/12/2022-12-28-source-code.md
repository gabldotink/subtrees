However, some students in our school claimed that using scripts in choosing courses is illegal in our school, so in Sept 2022, I changed my repository visuality into private, to prevent any possible threat, and from then on this repository will be shut down and no longer open for use permanently. After that, all the use of the project is illegal and may cause harm to the me.
