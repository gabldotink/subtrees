**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the Android app AnyTracker, which is only available on Google Play.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shervinkoushan.anyTracker

The infringer is Revanced, specifically this repository: https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches  
which lets users circumvent the Premium functionality of my app to become Premium for free (it is originally an in-app-purchase).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Probably you should take down the entire repository: https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches
This is since other apps are affected as well.
At the bare minimum, the files in this directory must be taken down: https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/anytracker/misc/premium

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

I obfuscate my code with Proguard to make it difficult to reverse-engineer.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

They override the Premium checks so that these always return true. Please take a look at the code here: https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/app/revanced/patches/anytracker/misc/premium/patch/UnlockPremiumPatch.kt

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Here are two forks that (as of this moment) are not yet updated with the violation of my copyright. They might be when you review this notice though (and they contain infringements of many other apps as is).

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**
