One of our developers accidentally included the wrong license on our project's source code, which was then forked by a potential freelancer developer who was unaware of this mistake. However, our project has since been sold, as indicated by the official website (sayches.com) and the UK Companies House website (https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12459045). Please note that after the sale of the project, the entire company's GitHub account was deleted ([private]). The continued public availability of the code could cause significant financial harm to our interests.
