https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/blob/1.x/LICENSE.md  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
SkySkipped violates our license in multiple ways to the best of my knowledge.  
  
Does not have the same license, SkySkipped is licensed under WTFPL, which is not a compatible license. A compatible license was removed in commit [private] while our code still remains.  
Does not state changes to the project, SkySkipped has damaged our reputation by not making it clear that their cheat is not the same as our mod and using our mod as a cover for their cheat.  
Private versions of SkySkipped are distributed by the author without making the source available.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
A non-exhaustive list of changes that must be made are:  
Changing the license to a compatible one  
State the changes made and make it clear that our projects are not related.  
Provide free sources of the project and any critical libraries that also infringe on our copyright when distributing releases.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Reported content must be removed  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
