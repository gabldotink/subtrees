the page in question is: https://github.com/OliveSonDev/DebateFace  
This user OliveSonDev used my content that I designed and created and put on Github. I've responded to his post under the "issues" tab describing the events that unfolded. The content he's showing there is mine and does not have permission to post this. I have saved convos with the dev from [private] which shows all of this.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copywrited work is all my content designs, user flow charts, etc... Pretty much everything he posted. This dev disappeared on me and never completed a project I had hired him to do. I hired him from [private] and have the original convo from it. He was kicked off [private] for violating their terms of service. I had to then communicate with him on [private], which I also saved the conversation. I eventually had to file a charge back with [private] because this dev disappeared on me. That's all my content that I designed and made he has shown there.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repo request should be taken down. I hired this developer from [private]. He then violated their terms of service and had to communicate with me on [private]. I have all the convo's saved from both [private] and [private]. This guy disappeared on me after I had made milestone payments. After him failing to respond I did a charge back with [private]. The content hes showing on this page: https://github.com/OliveSonDev/DebateFace is mine.

I hired this developer from [private]. Gave my designs and use workflows. He got kicked off [private] for violating their terms of service. I then had to continue with him on [private]. I've saved convos from both. He then stopped responding after I paid him for several milestones that weren't functioning properly. Then after he completely went silent I filed a charge back with [private].
