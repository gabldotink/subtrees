**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/2.0/phpseclib/Crypt/RSA.php#L1040-L1073 is the code that has been infringed.

Also, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/dragosgaftoneanu/okta-simple-jwt-verifier/blob/master/src/SimpleJWTVerifier.php#L184-L213 . If you replace [private] the code exactly matches. Like even the variables are an exact match.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

No

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

My code was pretty much copy / pasted with no attribution being given.

Copy / pasting the code is fine. The MIT license is very permissive in that regard. But credit still needs to be given where credit is due.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Add attribution.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
