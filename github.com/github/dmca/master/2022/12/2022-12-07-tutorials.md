**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the content located at https://github.com/i12bretro/tutorials

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. It appears that the user bertlandh pulled the code from [private] repository located at https://github.com/i12bretro/tutorials, changed the links in the footer area of the pages by editing the /includes/sites.json file, then re-posted them on their website. This gives the impression that these pages, and more importantly the steps outlined on each of the 100s of pages, are the work on bertlandh. This is the equivalent of copy/pasting a blog post or news article and replacing just the author's name with their own. I emailed bertlandh on Sunday 12/4 requesting that they remove the copywritten code from their repository at https://github.com/bertlandh/bertlandh.github.io/tree/main/tutorials and did not receive any response.

I am 100% certain the code found at https://github.com/bertlandh/bertlandh.github.io/tree/main/tutorials is my work because of the exacting content, distinctly identifiable user interface and bertlandh left the author meta tag in each of the .html files with my username, [private] ([private]).

Infringing code repository: https://github.com/bertlandh/bertlandh.github.io/tree/main/tutorials

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?
