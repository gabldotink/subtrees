**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have the following repository that's ARR: https://github.com/papa-smurf/Gargul

Recently someone forked it and removed a piece of code that could prove detrimental to my product over time. I'm trying to file a DMCA or similar to have that fork removed (https://github.com/SoglaHash/Gargul)

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I have the following repository that's ARR: https://github.com/papa-smurf/Gargul

This codebase is the basis of an add-on for a game called World of Warcraft. This add-on is not just for personal use, but is at its very core meant to be used in group settings. The "forker" changed my codebase without my consent or without even contacting me, despite my contact info being readily available.

The changes he made to my codewase WILL have a negative impact on how others perceive my work, and this is exactly what an all rights reserved license should protect me from amongst other things.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This fork: https://github.com/SoglaHash/Gargul, and more specifically this commit:

https://github.com/papa-smurf/Gargul/compare/master...SoglaHash:Gargul:nospam

Yes: it appears to be just this fork: https://github.com/SoglaHash/Gargul

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
