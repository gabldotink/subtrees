**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are Anlatan LLC, the developers of https://novelai.net/ we are the original owner of the copyright that has been identified from this repository and the identified forks listed. Anlatan LLC formed in June of 2021 and has been in active business ever since. Our trade is distinct and uniquely identifiable.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We have determined that a file within these repositories that Github is hosting violates our distribution rights as the repository contains instructions to illegally obtain leaked propertairy models of NovelAI, thus aiding and abetting software piracy. It falsely states that there are 'third party' service that is authorized to distribute and deploy the leaked proprietary model, then provides instructions to deploy said 'third party' service. Anlatan LLC retains the sole right to publish and distribute NovelAI models.

We have not granted the users nor GitHub permission to provide instructions to acquire leaked proprietary software. Based on the representative number of forks we have reviewed, we believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
