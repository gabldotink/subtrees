**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This is the only fork I have found that has any releases listed and the others all "seem" to be following the license as they should.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License  
https://github.com/SubnauticaModding/QModManager/blob/master/LICENSE.md

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

While he is perfectly in his right to have a fork and to modify it for his use the RELEASE of a compiled build that is modified is against the NoDerivatives portion of this license.

The QModManager team has requested that he remove the download links while we review his PR and he has refused.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Remove the release.

Having the repo and using it for personal use and/or making a Pull Request is perfectly fine but releasing a modified copy is not.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
