Hello there,  
I am the author of this repo.  
https://github.com/paraself/vuexy
The entrie repo is a vue state store wrapper, made with typescript class paradigm, to ease the cumbsersome working with the original vuex. It by no means copied any content from the claimer, whose content is a admin template.

The inspiration and coding all comes from my own personal expriences and interllectual hard working. I did not refer, copy, mimic, or modify any other external contents to form my own.

According to the claimer, the template they sell:  
https://themeforest.net/item/vuexy-vuejs-html-laravel-admin-dashboard-template/23328599
is clearly labeled, that the template is publised at 16 February 2019. However the very first commit of paraself/vuexy is submitted at 2018, ealier than the claimer's template.

Dispute the notice.

I belive the claimer only just searched for the same name, rather than check the content carefully.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**
