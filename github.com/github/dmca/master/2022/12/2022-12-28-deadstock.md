**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] for Deadstock, writing on behalf of the owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyright work is private and located on [private]

The Infringing material is located on a public GitHub profile: https://github.com/kysliakpavlo/deadstockV2-app

We hired a [private] developer, [private], to work on our Vue.js front end through [private]. [private] committed severe violations of [private] terms of use and was banned from the platform. [private] refunded us for the hours [private] had worked, and the [private] staff instructed us to refrain from communicating with [private]. We removed his access from our GitHub and other platform tools. Since then, he has been harassing our development and executive management team with threats.

[private] has since published our codebase on a public GitHub https://github.com/kysliakpavlo/deadstockV2-app exposing all of our secret keys and code to the public. [private] is under an NDA with Deadstock through [private]; since [private] illegally leaked our code base, our company has been exposed to significant risk. We will be taking legal action against him. Any information about this account that may help us during the litigation process would be greatly appreciated. I have reached out to the [private] legal department to request [private]'s physical address information so our law firm can send a cease and desist letter to begin the process.

I have copies of the communication from [private] support about the violations and instructions for us to terminate his access, etc. I also have a [private] text communication of [private] threatening our employees and us if we did not use some shady website to send him money.
