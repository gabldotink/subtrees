- The application was purely made from scratch and nothing was copied from anywhere.  
- The icons which were used in the application are taken with proper permission and credits were also given to the original owners.  
- The original copyrighted work that was said to be allegedly been infringed uses Android Open Source Project's Runtime Resource Overlay (RRO) along with Virtual Runtime Resource Overlay (Fabricated Overlay) which are open source and free to use for everyone which my application also uses directly from AOSP. As it is open source and free to use, it can not be subjected for copyright violation.  
- All the features which are used in the app are already open source and available in many other projects including AOSP and various custom AOSP based roms. So these also can not be subjected for copyright violation.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
