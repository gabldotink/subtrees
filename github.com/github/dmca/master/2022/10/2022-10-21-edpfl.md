This repository contains five notebooks that are used internally at the [private] course at EPFL. I am the copyright owner of these notebooks and do not permit their redistribution on GitHub.

As an addendum to a prior takedown notice: the issue here is not that the person in question is sharing their own work. Rather, it is that >90% of the files in the repository consists of copyrighted content (text, images, base code) created by myself that was copied along with modifications made by the student.
