**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I used to sell a product named makfn, here is my receipt for the makfn.com domain name [private] (please make sure to redact this PDF file when DMCA notice released publicly)

I am the sole copyright owner of this code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My product makfn had its source code leaked by someone who I didn't authorize to do such. I no longer actively sell the product, so I can't provide a live URL. However hopefully the receipt for the makfn.com domain name that I provided in the above field will suffice.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
