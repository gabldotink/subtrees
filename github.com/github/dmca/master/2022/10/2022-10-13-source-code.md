Hi Good day,

I am requesting to takedown/delete the repository that was uploaded by our previous programmer that is no longer working with us anymore.

Original Code

Our current environment and production is not affected by this publicly published code. But our code and flow are already exposed to the public. So we need your help to take down this repository.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
