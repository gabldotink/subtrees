While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the organization McLeodGaming Inc. (trademark: "McLeodGaming"), who owns the closed-source "Super Smash Flash Engine", which the reported code infringes upon:

[private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original source code is hosted in a private repository: [private]

The offender has reverse engineered some of the binary source code from the project and has been publishing its internal details on GitHub
https://github.com/pecefulpro/ssf2-modding

In short, the offender has obtained the code in a binary form by freely downloading it from its home web site, and has reverse-engineered the internal functions:

Game home page: https://www.supersmashflash.com/play/ssf2/downloads/

This is very obvious by looking at the generated doc code. For example:  
https://github.com/pecefulpro/ssf2-modding/blob/fef71b565321e33a85be75f17fc89c7bec09f5bd/docs/build/html/_sources/reference/API.rst.txt

Compared to the source:  
[private]

The offender is essentially using Github as a free hosting service to showcase the reverse engineered code.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/pecefulpro/ssf2-modding

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The game engine is compiled to a closed-source, binary format with all documentation removed. To reverse engineer requires disregarding the terms of use for the game, and going out of your way to manually decompile the code using special software and documenting the source code by hand.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

It seems like this project is connected to another project that we DMCA'd in 2020:  
[invalid]

The documentation even mentions "talk to a team member" about acquiring additional code needed to make use of this repo, referring to the DMCA'd project mentioned here:  
https://github.com/pecefulpro/ssf2-modding/blob/5fb6e56c0d097ad39b1e9c0a72f5c3ddaa4ea505/docs/source/tutorials/tutorial_1/install.rst

This suggests that the offender is trying to circumvent the copyright policies on GitHub and take advantage of the free web hosting

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found any open-sourced forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
