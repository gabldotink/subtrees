I'm fully authorized to act on behalf of Beijing Topsec Technologies Group(http://www.topsecgroup.com/, hereafter refer to "Beijing Topsec"), the copyright owner of the work described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Beijing Topsec has developed a product named {“TA-EX”}[private]。

The code for this product was originally uploaded to GitHub by a former employee ([private]) of Beijing Topsec and was not authorized by Beijing Topsec. We contacted him to delete the original repository(named "ex-sim-web"), but before he deleted it, a user forked it and we didn't notice it.

Recently, we found the fork of the original repository named "ex-sim-web" on GitHub. It has copyright notice of Beijing Topsec("北京天融信科技有限公司") in its code, which infringed the copyright of Beijing Topsec.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We have downloaded the code of the entire code repository for analysis, and found that the overall business logic and code of the code repository are the historical version of the {"TA-EX"}[private] of Beijing Topsec, so we request to delete the entire code repository. Thanks!
