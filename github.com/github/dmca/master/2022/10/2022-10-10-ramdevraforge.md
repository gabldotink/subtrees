I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice

A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon;  
The website seamacpiping.com has been made by us. All the content has been written by us on the site for the client.  
A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site;  
https://www.ramdevraforge.com/ has copied the complete site and replaced seamac with their name. You can check our DMCA filed with google here https://lumendatabase.org/notices/23437452

The website hosted is a replica of one of our clients. If you see the changelogs you can infact see the name too of Seamac Piping in the source code. Hence all URLs are infringing and not just one.

Even after repeated reminders and follow up, they are not taking the website down. The IP [private] links back to Github and hence I am reaching out to you.  
Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;  
Address: [private]  
Number: [private]  
Email: [private]

Github username of the infringer: hiralalp

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
