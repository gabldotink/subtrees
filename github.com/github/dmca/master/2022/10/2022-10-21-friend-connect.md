This is a tool for Minecraft server owners to allow console users to join servers. By default console users are unable to join user created servers. Realms (Microsoft provided servers) are unusable at mass scale. So many server owners may want the ability to expand without being limited by realms. Friend Connect allows console players to join user created servers. With a simple to use method that is easy for anyone to do. The other methods use unorthodox ways to join servers on console. These methods usually require console players to do stuff outside of the game to join a server. With Friend Connect, the player is able to add the server from within the game by adding a profile as a friend. The back end of friend connect gets the Xbox live token and keeps it refreshed. It fetches the followers of the profiles used and adds them as a friend. Once both profiles are friends, a session is added to the Xbox session directory for the host profile and the sub profiles join. These profiles appear as joinable to the console players that want to join a server. This also removes friends that unfollow the host and sub profiles. The sub profiles are profiles that join the session to allow more players to join. As each account has a max of 1000 friends, the more accounts the more players that can join. Before any requests are made to an Xbox API the achievements of each profile are checked to make sure if the accounts are not used.
