**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the [private] of the computer software known as Chevereto, for which I have a paid version named "Chevereto" released under a proprietary license at https://chevereto.com and a Free Software fork named "Chevereto-Free" at https://github.com/rodber/Chevereto-Free

Chevereto license terms can be found here: https://chevereto.com/license which forbid any code re-distribution or re-licensing.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Chevereto's entire proprietary code has been added to a GitHub repository without my permission or consent. A user took the paid software files and started to distribute it using GitHub under a different (no) license.

They took Chevereto proprietary libraries like Storage, Queue, Login, etc. Here the evidence:
