Inexture, a company based out of India, has breached our contract with them and posted sensitive information publicly on Github. Both live sites are active and working as our trademarked property:

www.buddipro.com  
www.buddibands.com

Here are the repositories they have posted illegally:

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our system is secured, the only reason this is happening is we hired a team out of India and in response to an agreement we were pursuing with them, they threatened to display our code publicly and followed through with it. They falsely used another one of our devs credentials to do so.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Again, this is a unique situation therefore, we are have changed all credentials so there is no possible way Inexture can gain access to our code again.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All of the code should be removed.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
