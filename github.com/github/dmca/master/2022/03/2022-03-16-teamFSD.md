I am a [private] of a group of home brew coders that was once known as teamFSD, now known as Team Phoenix. This repository states that they are posting our stolen code in the repo readme, and they dont care.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Freestyle Dashboard, unreleased Dashboard RXE source code from teamFSD, and all related libs included that were never released to the public, the code has no licence info in it, because it was leaked. Also, the owner of the repo admits that the code is stolen in their readme, and dont care.
