**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have DRM used to verify the integrity of the current game session. All of these "cracks" have illegally circumvented our DRM.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Since the project is written in Java, it is easier to circumvent than other projects. These cracks were made by modifying the bytecode of the JAR file and removing the integrity checks.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have found some forks which are listed below. I would also like all forks in the future to be taken down.
