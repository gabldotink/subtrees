I am part of the [private], and I have found code solutions for a class at Georgia Tech. Whenever student turn into their code assignments they agree to the Georgia Tech Honor Code stating they are not cheating or allowing others to cheat by sharing Georgia Tech’s assessment materials. The assignment materials were provided to students so that they could complete their tasks and isn't to be shared with others.
I requested the owner to make the repository private by creating an issue in their repository, and they didn’t make it private.
