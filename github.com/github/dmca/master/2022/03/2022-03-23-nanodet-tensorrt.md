**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I create a repository named NanoDet-TensorRT and make it public. The problem is that, another user forked it, and after that, I made my repository private. According to the Doc (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility), the forked version will remain public and still available on the github. Since I’m the owner of the original work (you can see https://github.com/hyaihjq/NanoDet-TensorRT/commits/master, all commits is singed with my GPG signature), I want to remove all the copies from the internet. My original work (repository) is made private, so I cannot provide its URL, but since the repository hyaihjq/NanoDet-TensorRT is a fork of my repository, I think there is no difference. 

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is made private, but the repo I want to be taken down is a fork of my original work. (I made my repository private, so there is no fork mark at that repository (NanoDet-TensorRT))

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I hope to delete the repo: https://github.com/hyaihjq/NanoDet-TensorRT. I try to contact the user (hyaihjq), but he/she do not provide any contact information, and the issue of the repository even be closed, which makes me confusing.

No, there is no fork.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, the user do not provide any contact information, and the issue is closed for all his repositories.
