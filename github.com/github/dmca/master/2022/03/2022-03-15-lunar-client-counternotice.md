"Lunar Client" is a piece of software developed by Moonsworth.

I am [private] and [private] of Lunar Client Qt. Lunar Client Qt is an alternative launcher for Lunar Client that aims to be faster and more friendly towards older hardware. It's important to note that Lunar Client Qt does not provide a copy of Lunar Client's code or assets, but instead requires its users to install everything through the official launcher provided by Moonsworth.

The takedown request claims Lunar Client Qt is an 'unauthorized copy' of Moonsworth's copyrighted works. This is simply untrue; neither of the projects that have been taken down contains any code or assets belonging to Moonsworth. It also failed to specify what part of the projects, or how the projects were violating Moonsworth's copyright rights, so it's impossible for me to know what I could do to resolve this.
