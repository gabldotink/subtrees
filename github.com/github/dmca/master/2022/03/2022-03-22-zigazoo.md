Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Last week, a portion of our source code was posted by an [private] contractor on github.com. The repository can be found here: https://github.com/ayazupwork123/zigazoo.  In doing so the contractor published proprietary information in breach of their agreement. The entire repository is infringing. It is a copy of the source code for our application. 

Please remove these materials from their public repository. Please also advise on next steps.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your consideration,
