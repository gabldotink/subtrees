**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The files in the repository are solutions to projects for a class [private] at Georgetown University. The designs of the project and the C++ classes are of my making and are covered by copyright. I distribute some of the code in the repository through my Web page and through my account on a secure server. I distribute additional material via lectures. There is a copyright designation on the Web pages for the project. Some of the files in the repository identify  [private] as the author. I never granted permission to the owner of the repository to post my copyrighted information.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work consists of software class designs and other source code that I distribute to students taking my class [private] at Georgetown University. I distribute the class designs via documentation that I post on the Web. The URLs for these pages appear below. I also distribute these class designs and other source code using my account on a secure Linux server on which my students have accounts. I also distibute class designs and source code via lecture. The student who presumably owns the repository took my class in  [private]. The student's name and his [private] appear in various files in the repository.

The repository contains solutions to two homeworks and five programming projects. I distributed the material for Homework 1 via lecture in its entirity, and so all of what appears in the GitHub repository is protected by copyright. I distributed the material for Project 3 via lecture including the source code for Stack<T>, and so it is protected by copyright. For Project 1, 2, 4, and 5, I distributed the material via secure server and through my Web site.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/boyatine/COSC-052

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

For some but not all of my copyrighted material, I distribute the material via course lectures and via a secure server using my account. Students also have an account on this server, and I grant them access to certain files that I distribute for an assignment.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The project itself is not designed to circumvent my technological protection measure. The owner of the account circumvented my protection measures by uploading by copyrighted material to his GitHub repository.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not searched for any forks. The repository does not appear to have been forked based on the information provided about the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

See: [private]

[private]. His e-mail address should be [private].

I sent two e-mails to [private] at the above e-mail address asking him to make the repository private, but I have not received a response. As GitHub recommended, I also opened an issue asking [private] to contact me. Again, I have received no response.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
