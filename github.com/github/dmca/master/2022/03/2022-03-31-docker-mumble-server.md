**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private]; this is [private] original Intellectual Property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed upon is source code for a Docker "image" which runs "mumble-server", and is posted online at https://github.com/sudoforge/docker-mumble-server.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-docker

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The first commit on the github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-docker repository uploaded a modified version of my content without honoring the constraints set forth in the license. As such, my Intellectual Property is being used in violation of its license and copyright. No further commits amended this until I reached out to the authors and informed them of the violation. As such, the previous commits are still in violation of the license, but amending this is something the authors are refusing to do.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-docker repository (and all forks) must be rebased and modified such that each commit in its history adheres to the terms of the license in the original (source) repository. If the organization wishes to build a project based on the source code found in the github.com/sudoforge/docker-mumble-server repository, its license requires that each commit contains attribution. The mumble-voip organization is welcome to use the "fork" feature of GitHub (or alternatively, upload my repository under a new name, with all of its commit history intact), after which, they can modify it as desired as long as the constraints of the license are honored.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

The best solution would be for the offending actors to follow the terms of the license from the project that they copied, pasted, and modified.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The alleged infringement exists under a GitHub Organization (mumble-voip), however, the following specific users have infringed on my work through commits on the infringing repository and any forks: of the infringing repository

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
