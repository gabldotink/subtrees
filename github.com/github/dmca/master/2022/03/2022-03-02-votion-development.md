In September 2021 our project group moved its repositories to a new organisation under the name "Votion Development" (https://github.com/Votion-Development/Dashactyl), prior to this it was under an old organisation "[private]" which has incorrect licensing for its repositories. At the time, a former organisation owner was conflicted on what to license the repositories under, it had remained under his name until his removal.
After his removal, we updated our repositories to be licensed under "Votion Development" and informed fork owners about this change. However, some repositories/organisations did not comply.
