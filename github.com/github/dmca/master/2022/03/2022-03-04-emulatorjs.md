**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright holder

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

original works: https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs

copyrighted works: https://github.com/Kooyle/DKA.GitHub.io (and this fork https://github.com/jifeng0003/eumjs )

I have no way to contact the user, I looked for an email and tried to open an issue but both repositories had issues turned off and both users had no email listed on their repository. The repository seems to be a fork of a previously taken down repository (see https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/02/2022-02-25-emulatorjs.md )

Contains modified core emulator files and contains code evidently a copied version of my original emulatorjs project.

I have ensured both the fork and the source repository contain infringed content

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The repository does have a fork, https://github.com/jifeng0003/eumjs contains modified code of the parent repository, but still violates the reported content.

Yes

**Which license?**

Apache License 2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The user is hosting a project containing modified code without stating changes or stating the licence

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Adding a licence and adding a link to my original https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs project.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

To give the user a chance to add a licence file to his project, but if he does not do so the project will need to be taken down

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
