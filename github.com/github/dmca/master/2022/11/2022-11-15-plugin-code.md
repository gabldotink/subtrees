**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

Yes, 1872570

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Yes, I am the copyright holder, as I am the [private], [private], and [private] of the work.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a [private] plugin written by [private]. The work is written in JavaScript and is intended for use within the [private] client. I have made it clear that using this code without permission or proper credit is not allowed.  
The owner of the repository has intentionally removed my name from the code of the work, as well as all documents associated with it to claim it as his/her own original work. Furthermore, they have created a README file in which they claim that "[they] made this plugin," which is simply not true.  
The original copyrighted work that has been infringed upon can be found at the URL listed below.  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riolubruh/YABDP4Nitro/main/YABDP4Nitro.plugin.js

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/SoyRage/ImNitro/blob/main/ImNitro.plugin.js  
Multiple attempts have been made to contact the repository owner, with no response. The repository owner has also attempted to put the MIT license on my copyrighted work without being the copyright holder. The file uploaded by SoyRage is almost entirely unmodified, only changing a few instances of my online name, "Riolubruh" with his own, "SoyRage", which I am confident does not fall under Fair Use.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Forks of my work are allowed as long as I am directly credited and/or asked for permission for my code to be used.  
I have searched for forks that infringe on my copyright and have found one, the link is as follows: https://github.com/1hAck-0/ImNitro.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

The repository should be privated or the infringing file(s) removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Their GitHub page lists their email as the following: [private]  
They also have a [private] account, and although it most likely will not be of help, it is the following: [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
