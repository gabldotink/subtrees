Dear Github: 

 

This is [private] of Tencent Games, China.

Recently, we have noticed that some Github repositories contain sensitive information about our company.

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, and decide to send this message.

 

We appreciate very much for your help and support.

 

Our company employees created a repository called "[private]" through our internal git repository 11 years ago. Unfortunately, this repository contained sensitive information such as links, documents.

All these information is owned by Tencent. However, we found that some users have forked the entire repository, such as whatmryang, MerlinXYoung and rdcentermrzhi. This cannot be controlled by our side.

We have tried to contact the user, but with no response.

 

The URL and the screenshot of one sensitive information example in the forked repository are shown as follows:

 

https://github.com/whatmryang/tsf4g2

https://github.com/MerlinXYoung/tsf4g2

https://github.com/rdcentermrzhi/tsf4g2

 
[private]
 

Since the repository contains critical source code and sensitive document information of our company, we do hope Github could help us to remove the above three repositories completely.

 

The following is our contact information:

 

路 Company Name: Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd

路 My email address: [private]

路 Cellphone: [private]

路 Website: https://www.tencent.com

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. 

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
