**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I worked on a freelance project with a client.  
- Our agreement is that once payment was made, he becomes the owner of the IP.  
- He claims to have initiated the transaction whiles I started working.  
- Upon completion, I have not received the payment and he currently has ownership of our IP.  
- He has ghosted and gaslighted me for 5 weeks now using many excuses.  

I am terminating our contract and for all my owned IP, I need it taken off.  

Most importantly, taken off without any alerts to him.  
- I own everything as you can see from the commits https://github.com/MufakirAnsari/LuckyDear-Project/commits

No work done by him, whatsoever.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
