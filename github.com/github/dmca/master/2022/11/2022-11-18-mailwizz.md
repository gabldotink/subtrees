Hello,

I got alerted by google as follows:
```
Dear Customer,  
We have detected a publicly accessible Google API key associated with the following Google Cloud Platform project:  

Project [private] ([private]) with API key [private]

The key was found at the following URL: [invalid]

We believe that you or your organization may have inadvertently published the affected API key in public sources or on public websites (for example, credentials mistakenly uploaded to a service such as GitHub.)
```

If you take a look at [invalid] they [invalid] cloned our business website [private] and that contains our maps key and that's the reason why google alerted us.

Furthermore, if you go to https://github.com/gridart/gridart.github.io you will see they took all email templates from our MailWizz business at https://www.mailwizz.com/free-email-templates/ and if you look in the history, you can see how they removed licenses which show we have the copyright: https://github.com/gridart/gridart.github.io/commits/main
