Dear Sirs/Ma’am,

Re:      Client: Quantiphi, Inc.

Misuse of our client’s works through the website ‘auduu.ai’

Our Ref: [private]

 

We write under instructions from and on behalf of Quantiphi, Inc. with its place of business at [private]. It is present in [private] through its subsidiary, Quantiphi Analytics Solutions Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, with its registered address at [private]. Together, the companies are hereinafter referred to as our client/Quantiphi.

 

Our client has created and posted content on its website www.quantiphi.comto explain the nature of its business, products and services provided by it. All such material and content which is posted on its website www.quantiphi.com is original and qualifies as ‘literary work’ over which copyright subsists in favour of our client, and such work is entitled to protection under the Indian Copyright Act, 1957.

 

Our client recently came across an entity, operating a website under the domain name ‘auduu.ai’. The entity has blatantly copied the contents of our client’s website www.quantiphi.com, including but not limited to content/text, visual appearance, presentation, graphics, data, and/or combination of all these elements on the abovementioned website. Upon comparison of our client’s website, www.quantiphi.com, and the website being hosted by you under the domain name ‘auduu.ai’, it is apparent that several pages, such as the ‘Data & Analytics’ page, ‘Marketing Analytics’, ‘Conversational AI’, ‘Customs AI’, ‘Infrastructure Modernization’, etc., have identical text and/or images to that of our client’s website. 

 

Thereafter, under our client’s instructions, we had addressed a take-down notice dated September 06, 2022 to Fastly, Inc. (attached) requesting them to take-down the impugned website forthwith. We were thereafter informed by [private] (attached) that the impugned content is being made available by Github, Inc. [private] also stated that they had shared our letter dated September 06, 2022 with Github, Inc. Accordingly, we reiterate contents of our letter dated September 06, 2022 and call upon you to take-down the impugned website www.auduu.ai forthwith.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

We thank you for your time and attention to this matter and look forward to receiving your confirmation within 7 days that you have duly taken-down the impugned website.

 

Yours sincerely,

[private]
