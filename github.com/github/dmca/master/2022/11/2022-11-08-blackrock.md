To whom it may concern,

I work with the [private] here at BlackRock, and have come across an ex-employees GitHub repository which contains code proprietary to BlackRock. Itâ€™s believed that this ex-employee worked on this code while employed at BlackRock, but has since left the company and has posted the code publicly through his GitHub Account.

BlackRock would like to request a removal of the code with the assistance of GitHub.

The code uses an API key and contains multiple references to BlackRock Investment throughout. See below for path details.

The below content uses proprietary BlackRock code, and has been published without consent from BlackRock Management Inc.
