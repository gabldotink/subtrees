**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I created the majority of the code base with the help of the other members of my group/organization.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My code, reuploaded at https://github.com/the5dcrew/encoder, was re-uploaded without my consent from a private repository which the owners of the5dcrew previously obtained by someone leaking it through unauthorized means.

The code in question generates data records for The Weather Channel's IntelliStar 2 systems. The code that is written helps to properly format and compress these records to send it over the UDP channel of the system's message ingest port.

On a side note, I should mention that [private] is, in fact, me. I am a transgender woman and have not had the opportunity to obtain a legal name change, so I apologize for any previous confusion in the matter.
