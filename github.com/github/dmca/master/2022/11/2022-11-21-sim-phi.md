I am the [private] of sim-phi repository.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
My initial repository is "https://github.com/lchzh3473/sim-phi". It shares my work with the public via Github Pages.  
However, I found some repositories that forked or re-uploaded my source code, but did not include the correct copyright notice, removed my name, or claimed to be the original author.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
All the *.js files removed my watermark, and their repositories are not including the correct copyright notice.
