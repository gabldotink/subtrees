Hi, thank you for reply the message.

 

Basically we have accidentally reported the official Cobal Strike repository (https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/community_kit) by directly copying the list of forks associated with a repository that was violating our image and brand policy (https: //github.com/cobalt-strike-community/community_kit = false).

 

This is the fundamental reason why we would like to restore the relevant and official Cobalt Strike repository (https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/community_kit). This repository is directly is directly concatenated with the following resource: https://cobalt-strike.github.io/community_kit/. Apparently, this resource was also disabled.   

 

Iâ€™ll wait for your comment. Thank you very much for your time and help!
