While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the [private] of Subliminator, a print-on-demand company that was founded in 2018. The company is registered in the Netherlands, with an address at [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/daisukesohma/subliminator-renderer

This URL contains parts of work that was done by in-house as well as some freelance developers on behalf of Subliminator. The profile of this person that is sharing this content however is not someone we have ever contracted, so we do not know who he is. We were made aware by another company, namely [private] that their and our repositories were shared on this account. It has been impossible for us to track down and find out who this person really is, as every developer we have ever contracted has signed an NDA with us.

There is no way for us to get in touch with this person, as we do not know who he/she is. But those are our repositories and this person has no right to share these anywere. It is part of our software, which is a [private] app, which can be found and installed on a [private] store through this URL: https://apps.shopify.com/subliminator

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Everything under this URL https://github.com/daisukesohma/subliminator-renderer needs to be taken down, as those are our repositories and contain our IP.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Access control for repos

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

While the user was working for our company, he had access to the source code which he saved it locally and uploaded later to github.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks were found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unfortunately not, as the name is not of someone we have contracted before. So my guess is a false identity has been used on the Github account.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
