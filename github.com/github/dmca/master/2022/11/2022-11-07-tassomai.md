**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am[private] and [private] at Tassomai Ltd, the owners of the copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our original copyrighted work is a bank of multiple choice questions and answers. We deliver these in small quizzes over time to our regular users. In a previous DMCA takedown we mentioned a user (@[private]) who was infringing our copyrighted work by storing a database (in a github repository) of our questions and answers.
Now though, this database is also being stored by several other users on github.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

In the normal course of use, our authenticated users are offered quizzes from our question bank only via a web client, i.e. the user has to be logged in to an active, paid subscription. Any user is allowed only to access material they (or their parents or school) have paid for. Nowhere is it available in bulk except to our own in-house content team via firewalled cloud-based databases and certainly not in the public domain.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The original copyright infringer (@[private]) created a bot to take quizzes much faster than a 'real' user would by accessing our API directly and bypassing the web client, and by then making it publicly available, they have been able to effectively pool their efforts to draw in as many of our copyrighted questions as they can, to then store them and redistribute them to other people who download the application.

Now, the accused in this notice have extracted and used this stolen database and published it in public repos on github.

The sole purpose of each of these repositories is to distribute our IP , and the substantive content is a database of said IP, which is why we require the entire repos, and not just parts of them, are taken down.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No
