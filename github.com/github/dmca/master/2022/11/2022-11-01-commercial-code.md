Hello,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
There are some private accounts on GitHub that fork a project involving commercial software code from an original account called [private]. The original account had deleted the commercial software code, but the forked repositories are still online. 


The forked repositories location of the commercial software code are:

1) https://github.com/zhuhaijun753/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
2) https://github.com/FlytoDY/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
3) https://github.com/isliulin/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
4) https://github.com/MarcoLee1989/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
5) https://github.com/simonwang0215/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
6) https://github.com/wooterpark/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
7) https://github.com/zhan92/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  
8) https://github.com/Zhouzhou1992/DuPower_SPC5775B_EMS  

Since the commercial software code cannot be reproduced privately, I request deletion of the forked repositories as soon as possible after receiving the email, and do not publish it in any other public places. Thank you for your support and understanding!
