Our Client, Star India Pvt. Ltd. is amongst India's most diverse media companies. It owns and operates various entertainment channels, including the popular channels Star Plus, Star Jalsha, Channel V, Life OK, etc. (hereinafter "STAR Channels"), which are statutorily licensed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Consequently, the exclusive right to broadcast, re-broadcast, transmit and communicate to the public the STAR Channels and the content broadcast therein vests in Our Client.

Star India Pvt. Ltd. is the exclusive owner of the  “Star Channels”. In addition to the above, Star India Pvt. Ltd. is the exclusive owner of several trademarks connected with “Star’s Channels”. 

We have come across that the pirate Application "Pikashow" is providing our client's exclusive content without any authorization.

Pikashow, is a rogue standalone pirate application, has plagued the M&E industry especially the OTT platforms with free content of over 3000 Indian and International TV channels, movies, TV shows, Sports, web-series etc. It is gaining popularity due to the content availability from all the popular OTT apps like Hotstar, JioTV, Airtel TV, SonyLiv, Voot18 and Zee5. The application is available on Android, Windows, Mac and Linux devices (mobile, smart TVs, Firestick, laptop/PC etc.). However, it’s unavailable on any official platforms such as Google Play Store, i-Tunes etc. as it is a rogue pirate app.

Based on our investigation, we have found that "Pikashow" is using your services for ‘app update check’ functionality on their application. Which is further indulged in the act of copyright piracy by providing unauthorized streams of digital content without consent of the copyright owner. Please refer below the evidence for your reference. Please act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material as listed below.
