Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

QQ music has encrypted a large number of musical works in the platform. Under encryption, those musical works can only be played in QQ music by users that have obtained the membership of QQ music. These measures are taken for protecting the copyrighted works in case they are misused or copied in the network without the authorization of copyright owner.

We use RC4 encryption algorithm encryption our music data, each music file have rand key with length 512 bit.
The key was encrypt by TEA encryption algorithm, the encrypt result save in music data's tail.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused code is for circumventing the encryption by altering the format of the musical works. Under encryption, the format of copyrighted musical works is qmc, mflac or mgg. The code can change the format into MP3 or FLAT so that the unencrypted music can be played through any media without obtaining the membership of QQ music.
