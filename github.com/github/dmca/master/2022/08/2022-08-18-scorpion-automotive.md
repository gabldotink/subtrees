---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] at the company "Scorpion Automotive" trading in the UK under the name "SCORPION AUTOMOTIVE LIMITED". I am acting on behalf of the company to remove an internal repository that was leaked by an external contractor.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The source code for our API that backs our website http://app.scorpiontrack.com/ as well as our iOS and Android applications.

Our repository was cloned from our [private] around February of 2021, by an external contractor. We believe this contractor then went on to upload it onto their own GitHub profile and potentially accidentally made the code public. This was not authorised, but we do not believe it was intentional at this time.

However the code is owned solely by Scorpion automotive and there has not been authorisation to distribute, or copy the code and put it into the public domain.

We can provide any information requested to prove ownership of this repository. Our git history was wiped from that project before it was uploaded. The domains listed in the docs are owned by us, and there are comments in the codebase written by previous developers at scorpion.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

GitLab is used and only approved users can clone the codebase

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

An ex contracting developer cloned the project and likely uploaded the codebase onto a public github repository, since then the original author has removed it however it looks like it was cloned again since then.

Yes, we cannot find any at this time, the original author looks to have removed the original repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
