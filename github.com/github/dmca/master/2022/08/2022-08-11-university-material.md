**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the original work, and retain copyright as set out in the terms of [private] commission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringing repository consists of unlicensed copies of a university-level assessment specification (`[private]`, titled "[private]", 11 pages) and related assessment source code (entire contents of `Code` directory). Note that the repository does _not_ contain any original work by a student. All material under this repository is property of [private], as can be witnessed by the author section of `[private]`, and by comparing their contents to the identical files hosted at:

[private]  
[private]  

(these are not public URLs and should be redacted in the published notice)

The maintainer of the repository is not a student, but somebody who uses the unlicensed material for the purpose of marketing their ghostwriting service. The repository does not contain any student work. Continued exhibition of the material in this unauthorized fashion would cause harm to the copyright holder and is likely to damage their reputation.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. All of the repository's content is infringing and will have to be removed to remedy the infringement.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at

As of 10 Aug 2022, no forks were shown by the Github interface.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
