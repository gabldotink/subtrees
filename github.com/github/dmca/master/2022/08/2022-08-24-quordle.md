**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] authorized to act on behalf of Quordle.com.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted works consist of a website, software code (HTML), graphics and related content located at  https://www.quordle.com (the "Quordle.com Content"). None of the Quordle.com Content is provided via an open source license or has been authorized for use in the manner described below.

 

The infringing content can be found at the GitHub repository located at  https://github.com/quordle-no-ads/quordle-no-ads.github.io (the "Infringing GitHub Repository") and at the website located at  https://quordle-no-ads.github.io (the "Infringing Website").

 

The Infringing GitHub Repository consists of software code and other assets that were copied directly from Quordle.com's website.  For example, the entire "assets" folder (located at  https://github.com/quordle-no-ads/quordle-no-ads.github.io/commit/b47602cb71ad0e975e195cb6e0bdd3d3f2c79709) includes original HTML code lifted directly from Quordle.com.  The other files in the Infringing GitHub Repository, including the favicons, website index, sitemap and graphics, were also copied from Quordle.com.  The descriptions of these assets, which include “Rename quordle.com to quordle-no-ads.github.io” and “Add last ad-free snapshot of  https://www.quordle.com” are admissions of this blatant copying.

 

The Infringing Website, which is hosted by GitHub Pages, consists of an almost exact clone of Quordle.com's website.  In fact, the only difference between Quordle.com and the Infringing Website is that the Infringing Website removed the banner ads.  This, of course, is the entire purpose of the Infringing Website -- to provide a non-monetized infringing alternative to the original site.  Even a cursory review of the Infringing Website reveals that it is essentially identical to Quordle.com and therefore infringes the Quordle.com Content.

 

Finally, as stated above, these infringing uses of the Qurodle.com Content have not been authorized by the copyright owner nor offered for use via an open source or any other license.
