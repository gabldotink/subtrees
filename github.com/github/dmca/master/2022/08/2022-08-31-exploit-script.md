---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the [private] of the work, it is not meant to be public, however someone I deeply trusted with access to the code has publicised it on github,  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

the work is a lua script for ROBLOX, an exploit made for a game on there, it was originally here in a private github repo: [private]
but that is an old version, the one that has been leaked on github is newer, as it was sent via [private] dms to the user who has illegally made it public.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/cynmod/academic

the entire repo should be removed as none of it is the uploaders work and he is simply spreading work other people have made, none of it is legally theirs.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

There was an authentication system (as seen in the original work, in the private repo provided above), however the user had access to the raw source code & deleted it.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The authentication system was removed as the user in question had access to the source code

There are no forks of the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
