**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the original work, and retain copyright as set out in the terms of [private] commission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringing repository consists of unlicensed copies of university-level assessment specifications (listed below) and related assessment source code (listed below). Note that the repository DOES NOT contain any original or independent work by any student: it is unlicensed content used to advertise a tutoring/ghostwriting service.

The copyright for the materials listed below in the repository [https://github.com/Ethereal-Jaunt/COMP3141/ is](https://github.com/Ethereal-Jaunt/COMP3141/is) held by [private], as can be witnessed by comparing the author sections of the pdf documents and by comparing the contents of the named files to the originals hosted at the locations named below in the "What files should be taken down?" section. Please note that the original URLs are not public and should be redacted in the posted notice.

The maintainer of the repository is not a student, but somebody who uses the unlicensed material for the purpose of marketing their ghostwriting service. The repository does not contain any independent student work. Continued exhibition of the material in this unauthorized fashion would cause harm to the copyright holder and is likely to damage their reputation.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. All of the repository's content is infringing and will have to be removed to remedy the infringement.
