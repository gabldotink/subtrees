**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the copyright owner of the game Zenless Zone Zero.

https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringing repository contains and displays openly the codes/source code of our game package, and these codes should not be copied and published anywhere, as it violates our terms of service (https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/zh-cn/company/terms) and infringes our copyright.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials in the infringing repo is not authorized by us, since our game just finished a closed beta test recently. We haven’t posted anything online yet. The owner downloaded the game package and cracked it to get the source code.

Please remove the repository or turn it private. This is the third time we sent the complaint. Trust us we are not a bot ☹

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository https://github.com/Razmoth/ZZZStudio

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
