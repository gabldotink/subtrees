I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

I hired this guy on [private]. I gave him access to my code in order to fix 2 bugs. He was unable to fix the issue so I removed his permission to the project. He has since uploaded my code from [private] to GitHub and is refusing to remove it. The code is my private work along with the keys in the env example file. He is attempting to extort me into giving him money to remove the code. Below is the link to the repo of his.

Yes the entire repository is mine. If you check the commits you will see my name [private] as the one who created code and the one who made most of the commits. This is my source code that I gave him access to privately. He cloned it and then uploaded it to [private] without my permission.

Id like to request this user to remove this repo and my source code and id like for the user to be banned.
