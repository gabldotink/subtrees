MY CONSOLE  
Notification Suspicious Activity Alert  
Publicly accessible [private] API key for [private] Cloud Platform project [private] (id: [private])  
Dear Customer,  

We have detected a publicly accessible [private] API key associated with the following [private] Cloud Platform project:

[private] (id: [private]) with API key [private]

The key was found at the following URL:   https://github.com/masculus/businessdata/blob/1dc561906d589b78397beba84cc766709f44c919/src/views/home/contact/index.js

We believe that you or your organization may have inadvertently published the affected API key in public sources or on public websites (for example, credentials mistakenly uploaded to a service such as GitHub.)

Please note that as the [private], you are responsible for securing your keys. Therefore, we recommend that you take the following steps to remedy this situation:  

If this key is intended to be public (or if a publicly accessible key isn’t preventable):  
Log in to the [private] Cloud Console and review the API and billing activity on your account, ensuring the usage is in line with what you expected.  
Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.  
If this key was NOT meant to be public:  
Regenerate the compromised API key: Search for Credentials in the cloud console platform, Edit the leaked key, and use the Regenerate Key button to rotate the key. For more details, review the instructions on handling compromised GCP credentials.  
Take immediate steps to ensure that your API key(s) are not embedded in public source code systems, stored in download directories, or unintentionally shared in other ways.  
Add API key restrictions to your API key, if applicable.  
The security of your [private] Cloud Platform account(s) is important to us.  

GO TO MY CONSOLE  
Sincerely,  
[private]

You have received this mandatory service announcement to update you about important changes to [private] Cloud Platform or your account.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

SRC and backend repositories need to be taken down. We have the evidence of when each commit was made. The user has changed the timestamp to show it was down in 2014 but the company was founded in 2021 and the user was hired to work as a contractor. The user was fired for his misbehavior and to seek revenge, the user has put up our code so please delete the entire repository https://github.com/masculus/businessdata
