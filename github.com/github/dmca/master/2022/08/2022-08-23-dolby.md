**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyrighter owners behalf  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
This user is posted Dolby copyrighted works in multiple libraries. These works are only available under a licensee from Dolby.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
The repositories we outlined contain Dolby copyrighted code. They are originated from an authorized implementation that was created for a cell phone to enable and official Dolby implementation. The user reiryuki has taken this implementation and ported it to unauthorized devices and is distributing this code and is receiving compensation through donations on github.  
  
Dolby’s copyright can be found called out in the following files:  
https://github.com/reiryuki/Moto-Dolby-G-Pro-Magisk-Module/blob/master/system/vendor/etc/media_codecs_dolby_audio.xml  
https://github.com/reiryuki/Dolby-Atmos-Magic-Revision-Magisk-Module/blob/main/system/app/Atmos/Atmos.apk  
https://github.com/reiryuki/Dolby-Atmos-Razer-Phone-2-Magisk-Module/blob/main/system/vendor/etc/media_codecs_dolby_audio.xml  
https://github.com/reiryuki/Dolby-Atmos-ZTE-A2019-Pro-Magisk-Module/blob/main/system/vendor/etc/media_codecs_dolby_audio.xml  
https://github.com/reiryuki/Dolby-Atmos-OnePlus-8-Visible-Magisk-Module/blob/main/system/vendor/etc/media_codecs_dolby_audio.xml  
  
While the individual copyright does appear in the files linked, those files are not specifically what is enabling Dolby’s technology but the repository as a whole works in conjunction with our code and libraries to produce Dolby’s audio technology. I highlight the copyrights in these files to help further prove our claim of the repository containing Dolby’s copyrighted code.  
  
Please let me know if this helps clarify the request.
