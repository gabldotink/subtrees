I am part of the Georgia Tech [private], and I have found code solutions for a class at Georgia Tech. Whenever student turn into their code assignments they agree to the Georgia Tech Honor Code stating they are not cheating or allowing others to cheat by sharing Georgia Tech’s copyrighted assessment materials. The copyrighted assignment materials were provided to students so that they could complete their tasks and no permission was given to share the copyrighted material.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. The repository contains code provided to complete assignments, and student agreed that the code was not to be shared when the accepted the Georgia Honor Code Agreement. The course page is located here: https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/summer-2021/ There is a note saying students don't have permission to post their completed assignments publicly. The code provided to the students is located: [private]  
(The assignments are the same for multiple semesters)
