**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
  
No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
  
GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am part of the Georgia Tech [private], and I have found code solutions for a class at Georgia Tech. Whenever students turn in their code assignments they agree to the Georgia Tech Honor Code stating they are not cheating or allowing others to cheat by sharing Georgia Tech’s assessment materials. The assignment materials were provided to students so that they could complete their tasks and isn't to be shared with others.  
  
As our team has recently assumed responsibility for [private], which is a computer science course, we have scrubbed GitHub and identified material that violates this policy. There are many user repos and files that I am submitting on this request, and if I need to break it up into smaller sections just let me know.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The repositories listed below are comprised of code provided to the students in order to complete assignments, and students agreed that the code was not to be shared when the accepted the Georgia Honor Code Agreement.  
  
As most of these repositories are labeled specifically with the course name and broken out by specific assignment, not only has this agreement been blatantly violated but it has been done so in a way that enables current students to access solutions to assignments with ease. As this is an integrity violation according to university policy, it is in the best interest of both current and former students as well as the school to make these repositories private.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
Each of these repositories have been reviewed in accordance with feedback provided in an earlier DCMA takedown request submitted to the GitHub team. I have verified that each repository is comprised of exclusively course material, and though students have modified the base code provided the assignments themselves are still protected under university policy. As I mentioned in a section above, whenever students turn in their code assignments they agree to the Georgia Tech Honor Code stating they are not cheating or allowing others to cheat by sharing Georgia Tech’s assessment materials. The assignment materials were provided to students so that they could complete their tasks and isn't to be shared with others.  
  
The majority of these repositories contain all the code provided and built upon for every project in the course. You'll see this broken down in subdirectories by Assignment 1, Assignment 2, etc. Others are comprised of only the team and/or group projects for this course. As these projects are broader in scope, they still are made in accordance with strict course guide lines to fulfill a very specific set of requirements. Though it is more difficult for future students to leverage these more unique code bases they are still often leveraged which is, again, a violation of very explicit Georgia Tech requirements. If these were uploaded in standalone repositories as separate projects, it would be difficult to identify them as course projects, but due to their naming convention in relation to the specific course name and number they were identified by the integrity team for policy violations/removal requests.  
  
If there is additional documentation we can provide to illustrate this clear agreement entered into by the students just let me know.  
  
With this as background, we are once again requesting the complete repos be made private for the following URLs:
