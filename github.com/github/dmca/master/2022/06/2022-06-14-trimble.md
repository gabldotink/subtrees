**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for SketchUp at Trimble Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We provide an encryption service for our extension developers to encrypt the code for their extensions. A number of our developers have contacted us letting us know that our encryption has been decrypted and the code for the decrypter is posted to Github. As a result of this, their copyrighted source code can be decrypted.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository should be taken down. It's sole purpose is to offer the ability to break through our encryption:

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

SketchUp offers an encryption tool to our developers that are writing their extension code in plain text Ruby. Our encryption tool turns the plain text into an encrypted format that can only be unencrypted by our software when our software runs the extension. Extensions can then be distributed to our end users and our end users do not have the ability to read the code or alter the code. If end users could read and alter extension code, it would allow them to do things like circumvent any licensing mechanisms built into the extensions.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repository offers a decryption mechanism that allows anyone to decrypt these extension files. The decryption should only be done within our software.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

These are the forks we are aware at the time of submitting this form.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We only have his Github account. https://github.com/pcclark4

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
