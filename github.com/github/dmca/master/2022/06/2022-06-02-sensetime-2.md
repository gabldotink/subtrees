**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm fully authorized to act on behalf of Shenzhen Sensetime Technology Co., Ltd (hereafter refer to “SenseTime”), the copyright owner of the work described below.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

SenseTime owns a registered copyright named “Embedded Face SDK Software [or simply: embFaceSDK] V3.0.0” relating to its license product named “SZMobileFaceSDK” in China, and the copyright registration number is 2017SR331660. Source codes and all information of the above registered copyright, which are all developed by SenseTime itself and should be proprietary and confidential, were released by certain third parties (Github users “lbr77”, “Khoiron065”, “V1t0rrr”, “Doraemooonnn”, “aryankaran”, “crdroidandroid”, and “vayu-evergarden”) and posted into repositories in Github without authorization. These repositories infringe SenseTime’s copyright as they contain source codes which are exactly the same with the content of SenseTime’s registered copyright and in all of these infringing files are clearly specified statements declaring SenseTime’s license SN number and/or information of SenseTime’s copyrighted products.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We confirm that all files in the URLs as provided below infringe SenseTime’s registered copyright and hope them to be removed ASAP. Specific links to the infringing files to be removed are:
