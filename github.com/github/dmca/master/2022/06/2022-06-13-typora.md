[private] wrote and own the source code of app Typora

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] encrypted the source code of the app, and end users needs to input a license to activate the app.  
In our EULA, users are also not allowed to do "adapt (except as otherwise provided in this EULA), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of the Software and the License Key or any parts thereof, except to the extent permitted by applicable law." (https://support.typora.io/License-Agreement/ 4.2.7)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire https://github.com/taozhiyu/TyProAction

From the description "Maybe you can search Typro in search engine, such as google, baidu, Yandex etc. Maybe you cannot find what TyPro is, but you might find out some similar software, website or some other useful things. :-)" (https://github.com/taozhiyu/TyProAction#what-is-typro) and screenshot (https://github.com/taozhiyu/TyProAction/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L75) and source content(such as https://github.com/taozhiyu/TyProAction/blob/main/scripts/mainUpdate.py#L40), obviously this repo is providing crack of our app -- Typora.

And please remove its Github Action as well.

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, in detail:
