I am an agent for Mojang Studios - A Microsoft/Xbox game studio.

http://minecraft.net Education Edition. This repo contains tool that allow end users to bypass built in game authentication

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We use Azure Active Directory sign in with license checks to prevent unauthorized access to our application (Minecraft: Education Edition). We also use industry best practices such as compiled code and encrypted sub-components to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access to our application

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This user has presumably decompiled and reverse engineered portions of our code to find how to bypass our licensing checks. Their code goes against our EULA and Terms of Use by bypassing server-based authentication and changing memory state on the client to simulate a successful sign in without actually performing any form of authentication or license check with the authentication server.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?
