1. A Golang project, that leverages go-rod library (headless chrome) and gin-gonic (a HTTP web framework). It accepts an email via a GET request (gin-gonic), launches chrome (go-rod), goes to the Google page, enters the email and intercepts the parameters sent, it then returns one of the parameters sent as a response to the GET request sent via gin-gonic.  
2. A part of Golang code in a reverse proxy (evilginx2). It intercepts and reads a lot of the parameters sent in a specific request (common/GetCredentialType), it then sends the parameters to an API endpoint, reads the response from it and uses the domain/URL value (FederationRedirectURL) in the response to modify the reverse proxy (evilginx2) to proxy that specific site and rewrite URLs on that site to something else.  
3. Three different phishlet files for evilginx2. They contains instructions for the evilginx2 reverse proxy on how to proxy specific sites, what to capture from input, how to capture email/password, what to replace on the site  
4. A reverse proxy based on evilginx2 and named the same way, it has been majorly overhauled and rewritten.
