**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of [private] which owns the authentication software https://keyauth.win

[private] have developed all code being disputed in this notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The alleged infringer has stolen [private] code despite [private] license prohibiting this https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Source-Code/blob/main/LICENSE_KEYAUTH.txt

First, for the repository https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaAuth-class-file/, you can see the alleged infringer stole the code https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaAuth-class-file/blob/3d011b9638083af7d9abab6b1d3ffc6a0bcd837d/SonaAuth.cs#L22 from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CS-Example/blob/e1271c0f021382fefed83982b0afe3419a36f16d/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L26. Same variable and class names, same code to check if passed strings are null or have whitespace. Also if you look a few lines down, you can see that the data structures are the same between files. Comparing the function at https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaAuth-class-file/blob/3d011b9638083af7d9abab6b1d3ffc6a0bcd837d/SonaAuth.cs#L255 with the function at https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CS-Example/blob/e1271c0f021382fefed83982b0afe3419a36f16d/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L577, you can see the alleged infringer stole all the same code as [private], and the same request structure. Lastly, if you compare this encryption class https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaAuth-class-file/blob/3d011b9638083af7d9abab6b1d3ffc6a0bcd837d/SonaAuth.cs#L420 with [private] encryption class https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CS-Example/blob/e1271c0f021382fefed83982b0afe3419a36f16d/Console/KeyAuth.cs#L970, it's quite evident the alleged infringer stole [private] encryption functionality as well.

Also, if you're skeptical of the date of [private] https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CS-Example repository, please note that it's the same code as [private] old repository https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example which was removed due to a commit by a contributor that broke GitHub ToS. I've made an appeal but it's still not up yet. Though the date on that old repository is far before the one of the alleged infringer.

The files https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaAuth-class-file/blob/main/SonaAuth.cs, https://github.com/SonaFreelance/Sona-example-login-register/blob/main/SonaExample/SonaAuth.cs, and https://github.com/SonaFreelance/SonaExample/blob/main/SonaExample/SonaAuth.cs are very similar;so hopefully the evidence corroborated above is sufficient for removal of those repositories.

Next up we have the repositories in where https://github.com/SonaFreelance/python-class-file/blob/main/sonaauth.py and https://github.com/SonaFreelance/python-example/blob/main/sonaauth.py are the most infringing. However, the entirety of the repositories are infringing, I am just highlighting the part with the most infringement.

Comparing https://github.com/SonaFreelance/python-class-file/blob/449a08b817c0564d85c21728592a808cebe33b68/sonaauth.py#L27 with https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/6cb1578254c5c881c9c9d520b9e74b9a273601d9/keyauth.py#L31, you'll see the same variable and class names, same code to initialize the variables. Furthermore, if you compare https://github.com/SonaFreelance/python-class-file/blob/449a08b817c0564d85c21728592a808cebe33b68/sonaauth.py#L41 and https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/6cb1578254c5c881c9c9d520b9e74b9a273601d9/keyauth.py#L48 you'll see nearly the exact same code, and request structure. Lastly, viewing the encryption class https://github.com/SonaFreelance/python-class-file/blob/449a08b817c0564d85c21728592a808cebe33b68/sonaauth.py#L218 with [private] encryption class https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/6cb1578254c5c881c9c9d520b9e74b9a273601d9/keyauth.py#L472 brings up an identical match, making it quite evident the alleged infringer has stolen [private] code and violated [private] copyright.

And for a couple more pieces of evidence, the alleged infringer forgot to remove [private] authentication system name, KeyAuth, from one of the files he stole [private]. The alleged infringer's ToS [private] is also nearly identical to [private] service's ToS https://keyauth.win/terms/

I believe I've proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged infringer has in fact stolen [private] code multiple times, and I wish for [private] stolen content to be removed and if possible blacklisting to be done to prevent a repeat of this.
