To whom it may concern,

My name is [private] (a.k.a “[private]”, “[private]”, “[private]”) and I am writing to notify you of the copyright infringement and unlawful use of [private] copyrighted material that appears in the repository titled "police-panic" by "screwdev".

The alleged infringing material appears at the following location:  
https://github.com/screwdev/police-panic

The original material is available at the following location:

It would appear to any reasonable person that the alleged infringing material has been taken from “Inferno Collection: Police-Panic” (the “Software”), of which [private] am the legal copyright holder. The repository in question has not made use of the GitHub Fork feature and is a copy of the original repository. The repository in question is not in compliance with the license, as use of the Software or substantial portions of the Software without the copyright and permission notice is a direct violation of the license the Software is available under, which can be found here: https://github.com/inferno-collection/Police-Panic/blob/master/LICENCE.txt

Furthermore, the following commits show the deliberate removal of the copyright and permission notices from the alleged infringing material, required by the license the Software is available under:

The alleged infringer's E-Mail, as listed on the website linked to their GitHub profile page, is "[private]".

I respectfully request the readdition of the copyright and permission notices required by the license, or the removal of the aforementioned infringing material.

I also request that you notify the infringer of this notice and inform them to cease any further posting of the Software without the copyright and permission notices required by the license in the future.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,
