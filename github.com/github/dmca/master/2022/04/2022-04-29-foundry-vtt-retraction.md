I am [private] of the Japanese community which enacted a DMCA takedown notice as below:

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/04/2022-04-14-foundry-vtt.md

We have discussed off the court and reached an agreement that the DMCA takedown on the community's part was not appropriate and would like to officially retract the DMCA notice on the following repositories:
