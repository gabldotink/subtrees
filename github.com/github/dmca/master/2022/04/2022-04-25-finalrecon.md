FinalRecon is a web penetration testing tool. This is a popular tool in the cyber security community as it is available in official Kali Linux and BlackArch Linux repositories.

They have replaced the following things :  
1. Tool name i.e. FinalRecon  
2. Author name i.e. thewhiteh4t  
3. Edited and cropped banner image  

rest of the code and content of README and other such files is exactly same as the original

Original work : https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon

Since all of the files have been copied as is I am linking whole repository :
