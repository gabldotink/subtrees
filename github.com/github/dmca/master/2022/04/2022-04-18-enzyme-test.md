**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have been hired by the client of this site - to create the frontend code. Its been directly stolen and uploaded to this gitrepo by [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I created the reactjs components for a project I am working on for a client. I seeked this user's help 3 months ago about writing enzyme tests - he failed to complete the job. I have recently been alerted to an api key compromise and now can see he has pushed code to this repo without my authorization.

Its a complete violation.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[invalid]

https://github.com/Yasir900aslam/CIS/tree/main/frontend

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

there appears to be only this master branch

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

they have copied the entire codebase with little to no modification - I only became aware of this recently becomes google emailed us informing that the api keys had been exposed

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I thought at first it was part of the devops team - and did ask to make the repo private -- but after investigation it was a very old contact not authorized to reproduce or recreate the codebase.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
