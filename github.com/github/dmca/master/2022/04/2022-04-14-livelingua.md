We are the [private] of LiveLingua.com. About 2 years ago we hired a contractor on [private] to help with a project. The contractor claimed to be from the [private] at first, then later claimed to be a programmer from [private] working for somebody from [private] and then stole our payments and did not complete the work.

Just this morning our [private] noticed he has uploaded the full code he worked on to his repository and claimed it as his own by removing all our comments. You can probably find the code he has uploaded in our repository stored here as well under [private] account. It is a version from 2 years ago.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is a private company and the programmer does not own this code. By making it public he is putting all of our thousands of users who learn languages with us at risk.

You can find the front end of the code at LiveLingua.com.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
