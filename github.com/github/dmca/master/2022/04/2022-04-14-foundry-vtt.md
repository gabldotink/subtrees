Foundry VTT: A virtual tabletop for playing TTRPGs. Modules developed under this license: https://foundryvtt.com/article/license/v
Japanese Foundry VTT community: A Japanese community made of volunteers who operate to use Foundry in Japanese. Provider of the localization module in question. https://twitter.com/FoundryVTT_JP

As the [private] of the Github repository, discord server, and Twitter account for the Japanese community, I am authorized to act on behalf of the community during this case.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

URL of the original work: https://github.com/BrotherSharper/foundryVTTja  
URL of the infringing work:  
- https://github.com/Yasnen/fvtt-wfrp4e-ja  
- https://github.com/Yasnen/fvtt-ja

The infringed work is a community-maintained localization module for Foundry VTT's core software and modules, which do not have up-to-date repositories. Ownership of this module belongs to the volunteer work of multiple people (Including myself but NOT the person infringing). What is included in this module is the core localization ja.json, which is the infringed file.

The original work allows reproduction and usage by anyone under the following terms:

- Attribution is required if this is bundled or used in public places such as youtube videos, TTRPG replay archives, streams, repositories, etc.
- If the user uses this module for profit, they must join the discord server, including the attribution above.
- The above limitations are waivered if the user is part of the community's 4$ Patreon tier.
- Corporate entities are not allowed to use this without any prior discussion for unique licensing with the community.

The infringing person has admitted to using the infringed work during the making of the infringing work. As seen in their response here.
https://github.com/Yasnen/fvtt-wfrp4e-ja/issues/1

We have further proof from discord messages of the user admitting to using the infringed work; however, we believe that the message above is enough proof.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Files to be taken down:  
- https://github.com/Yasnen/fvtt-wfrp4e-ja/blob/main/lang/fvtt-ja.json  
- https://github.com/Yasnen/fvtt-ja (the entire repository)  

Why does this infringe:

- The infringed work has been used in partial and in full as a basis for the infringing file.  
- The person infringing has openly admitted to using the infringed file, which falls under the license of the infringed work, requiring citation.  
- The infringing work re-distributes parts of the infringed work under no license, which is not allowed in the infringed work's license.

During the "Ask nicely" phase, we asked the infringing person to give proper citations to the works they used when creating his repository.  
They refused.

We declare this repository as infringing on community rights and efforts.  
The current localization efforts directly result from multiple people's time and effort. While it is free to be used, referenced, or modified by anyone, they are required to provide citations as stated by the license.

The core localization efforts and current ongoing efforts to promote and sustain Foundry VTT's ecosystem in Japan are solely the merits of the community, and the license set forth by the community does not allow third-party entities to use this without accreditation and acknowledgment.

None that I know of during the writing of this.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
