The https://github.com/cran/minque repository contained a mirror of the code of the minque R package, published under the GPL-3 license.

This package was originally published by its authors at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/minque/ (older versions are at https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/minque/) under a GPL-3 license.
