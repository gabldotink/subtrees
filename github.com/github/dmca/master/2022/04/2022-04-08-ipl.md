1. We represent the legal interests of the Board of Control for Cricket in India ("BCCI") the governing body for cricket in India and the governing body of the TATA Indian Premier League 2022 ("IPL"). The unauthorised use of the IPL proprietary footage, names, marks and logos by mobile applications, Stream India and Nika TV ("Mobile Applications") and whose application dependency repositories made available on GitHub, has been brought to the BCCI and Star India Private Limited's (“STAR”) attention.  
  
2. At the outset, please note that any unlicensed commercial use and exploitation of the names 'Indian Premier League', ‘TATA IPL', 'IPL T20', 'IPL', 'IPL Twenty20' or any combination thereof; or the BCCI’s proprietary logos and marks (including those of current and previous editions of the IPL), the IPL team names, marks and logos, the IPL trophy or images constitutes an infringement of the BCCI’s intellectual property rights. In addition, the IPL and its official broadcaster retain all rights to license live streaming of footage (live or otherwise) relating to the IPL ("IPL Footage"). In addition, any unauthorised or unlicensed commercialisation of IPL Footage constitutes a violation of the BCCI's as well as its official broadcaster's rights. These rights include, without limitation, TV Live Broadcast Rights and TV Highlights Rights, Mobile Rights and Internet Rights for Live, Deferred, Delayed broadcasts and Highlights for all matches relating to the Licensed Properties on television and on the Internet (“Exclusive Rights”). These Exclusive Rights have been licensed to STAR for the entire world and as an authorized licensee it is entitled to enforce these rights.  
  
3. To our knowledge, the Mobile Applications and its use of the IPL proprietary footage, name, mark and logo therein have not been licensed by the BCCI. Further, its use of the IPL proprietary footage, names, marks, logos and other recognizable elements on the mobile applications represents a clear attempt on the part of such third party to commercially associate with the BCCI and benefit from its immense popularity and goodwill. In as much as it creates a false impression of an official association between such third party and the BCCI, the mobile application being made available by them may be subject to an action for passing off. Please be advised that the BCCI takes serious note of any such violations, whether or not intentional, and will do all things necessary to protect its rights in this matter. The Sports channels available on the Mobile Applications stream IPL footage without any license.  
  
4. With this as background, we demand that, on behalf of GitHub and all of its functionaries and affiliates, you  
  
(i) acknowledge receipt of this copyright submission immediately;  
(ii) cease and desist from listing Mobile Applications or API dependency codes of Mobile Applications using the IPL proprietary footage, names, marks and logos on your platform;  
(iii) remove all references to the IPL and Star Sports, its proprietary names, marks, logos and all references to related names and marks from the listings of unlicensed third parties; and  
(iv) ensure unlicensed developers cease and desist from associating, in any manner whatsoever, with the IPL and/or BCCI and STAR.  
  
5. This notice is not, and is not intended to be, a complete statement of the facts or law as they may pertain to this matter or of the BCCI’s positions, rights or remedies, legal or equitable, all of which are specifically reserved.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
