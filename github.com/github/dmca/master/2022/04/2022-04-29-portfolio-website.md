**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My portfolio website, including its assets, have been copied and rebranded a number of times on a single repository without my permission. They still host files that include my copyright and have also left other assets (such as my resume) on their github repository. In some cases they removed my copyright notice. This hurts me because Google search crawls github and thus links to their github instead of my site. I contacted 2 people involved but did not hear back from them.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My portfolio website is an original work with source code made by me including original assets such as my resume. They have been copied ("ripped") and only some pages have been modified (by people within the same group / repository) to make it seem like they made the portfolio website.

My portfolio website: [private]  
Original source code: [private]  
Resume: [private]  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following subdirectory contains 8 copies of my portfolio. Some have slight modifications made to it, such as removing my copyright notice, changing my name, and changing some of the colors / content of the index page. Most of them are identical to my portfolio including my resume.
