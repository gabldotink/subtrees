These games were developed by 'ZUN Soft (later Team Shanghai Alice)' and released on floppy disk between 1997 and 1998.  
These games can be played on the NEC PC-98 series.  
They are very difficult to obtain legitimately, as they are no longer manufactured or sold.  
  
Since this game is a private production, there is no independent website.  
A demo version of the game can be obtained at this URL:  
http://www.kt.rim.or.jp/~aotaka/am/
