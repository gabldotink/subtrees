**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am one of the [private] and the [private] for the course whose private content this person has published. The other authors are all either colleagues or employees of me.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

A student downloaded our documentation for the course labs (assignments) and all of the starter code from our protected Learning Management System ([private]) and shared it publicly on GitHub. Theses materials are from the Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Computer Science [private], where I am the [private] and one of the [private] of the materials. The other authors include the course creator and the teaching assistants. I am authorized to act on their behalf. Here is our course public web page: [private]

The files in question include the lab documentation, which tells students what they need to do (such as https://github.com/ztreble/MyRepo/blob/main/CS6340/Lab1/CS%206340%20-%20Lab%201%20-%20Fuzzing.pdf) - there are 8 of them posted, most of them posted under the [private] folder and also under the [private] folder in the repo. All of the other files found under the [private] folder were provided to students. In each lab, students were expected to submit four or fewer of the files that they had changed. All of these files came with headers stating our copyright information - which this student has conveniently stripped from the copies on GitHub. The source of all of our files provided to students except for the PDF instructions (which originate on [private]) is [private], although I am not sure I have a way to give non-GT access to this repository.

Everything included in https://github.com/ztreble/MyRepo/tree/main/CS6340 includes content for which I hold the copyright and this person is explicitly forbidden from distributing in our course materials. This content has also been forked to https://github.com/jiangjiang7758/MyRepo/tree/main/CS6340 where the content is identical and should also be removed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ztreble/MyRepo/tree/main/CS6340
https://github.com/jiangjiang7758/MyRepo/tree/main/CS6340

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/jiangjiang7758/MyRepo/tree/main/CS6340

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Based on our plagiarism detection tool (http://moss.stanford.edu/) and the work students submitted this semester (since the PDF instructions in the repo say "Spring 2022"), the only student who was an exact match to this code was [private] [private] also [private]. However this student is not responding to my attempts to contact them and most of the writing on the [private] GitHub page is in [private] so I cannot read it. The second highest match is [private] [private] but it seems unlikely that someone would post different work than they submitted, so I suspect [private] is either just a viewer or is the one who forked the repo. I would be shocked if any of these students had their [private] accounts associated with their GitHub accounts.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
