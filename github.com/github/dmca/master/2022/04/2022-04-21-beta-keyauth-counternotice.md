**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of this code and the [private] of the authentication system this code is meant for, https://keyauth.win. This DMCA takedown is fraudulent and has no basis. The DMCA takedown was submitted by an disgruntled [private] of mine. He assisted me with support tickets my customers made, and moderated my [private] server. Though he has absolutely zero ownership of my code. I request an immediate restoration of my repository, and if possible safeguards to be put in place to prevent this user from creating further fraudulent DMCA takedowns.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/wnelson03/beta-keyauth

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

There was a falling-out between this former [private] of mine, and he's reserved to creating this fraudulent DMCA takedown. He's also threatened to dox and SWAT me, an action where you leak someone's home address and then have the local police department raid the house. I am not concerned for my safety, as I employ the proper OPSEC measures, though I am cognizant of his threats towards me and my other administrators. I am prepared to defend myself legally and would like to see this repository restored given the fact my former administrator had no involvement with the development side of my service.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
