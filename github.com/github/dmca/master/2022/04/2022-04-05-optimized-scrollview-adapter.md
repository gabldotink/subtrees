**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I, [private], am the copyright holder of several source codes in question (below) which is licensed as per Unity's Asset Store EULA it cannot be publicly available: https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] selling this asset at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/optimized-scrollview-adapter-68436 since 2016. Recently, I encountered a sudden drop in sales, with a historical 20-day streak of no sales, which brought immense worry, as I rely on this income heavily.
The URL contains all of the package's contents an it already has 5 forks, making this spread with exponential speed: https://github.com/dingxiaowei/Optimized-ScrollView-Adapter

They also link to their GitHub page from these official website:

[private]  

I've already taken down the content from several websites, but the GitHub case is as dangerous as it gets, as the network effect makes it spread beyond my capability of reporting them.

As additional supporting arguments, they illegally exposed to the public domain the following assets as well and their owners don't probably know about it:
[private] -> lots of different packages that are PAID  
[private] -> officially at -> [private]    
[private] -> officially at -> [private]   

Out of the 250 repos it has, I'm sure thre are several others that violate copyright law, that are yet to be discovered.

I urge immediate action against this user's account, as their intents are undeniably malicious. I request a takedown of the repo with [private] asset 'Optimized ScrollView Adapter',
but I also kindly ask you to consider taking down their entire account ASAP as that will minimize the harm for more people than the 'good' that he/she think does by providing the
asset to 'those that cannot afford it' (which is surely what this user tells to him-/herself to justify this criminal act)

I also kindly ask you to consider taking down the following accounts as well as they serve as a 'backup' for the repos via the forks they have to the above-mentioned assets, including mine:
