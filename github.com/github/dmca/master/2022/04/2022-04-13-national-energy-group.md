**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**


The nature of this copyright ownership is related to the property of the National Energy Group Corporation and I am the authorized agent of my client.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

5 years ago, I was engaged in the [private] of the National Energy Group. After the [private] was completed, I accidentally uploaded the core code of the system to GitHub.   
The upload record is as follows:  
https://github.com/lstarby/snaq/commit/05ed3645340a899b5711d07e79c5cd175cb3ae31

After discovering that the code has leaked company confidential information, I will delete the uploaded core code base. The repository has been deleted and the deletion history cannot be found.  
It was recently discovered that some developers at the time copied the code repository by Fork. Recently, the company requested to delete the relevant code warehouse due to the disclosure of company secrets.  
The relevant evidence is as follows:
