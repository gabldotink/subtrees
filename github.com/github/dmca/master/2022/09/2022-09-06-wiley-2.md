No one is authorized to exhibit, reproduce, transmit, or otherwise distribute Wiley Properties in this manner without the express written permission of Wiley, and the unauthorized distribution of Wiley Properties constitutes copyright infringement. This conduct may also violate the laws of other countries, international law, and/or treaty obligations.
