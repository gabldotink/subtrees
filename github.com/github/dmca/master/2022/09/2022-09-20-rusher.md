Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have DRM used to verify the integrity of the current game session. All of these "cracks" have illegally circumvented our DRM.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Since the project is written in Java, it is easier to circumvent than other projects. These cracks were made by modifying the bytecode of the JAR file and removing the integrity checks.

Yes. The identified forks should be taken down.
