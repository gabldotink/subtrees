**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am authorised on behalf of SAMMI Solutions and as [private] of the organisation to submit this take down notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is the Documentation repository for the SAMMI program, developed by SAMMI Solutions. SAMMI Solutions was previously known as the GitHub account '[private]' and the name change is due to a rebrand.

The URL to the the SAMMI Solutions repo is here: https://github.com/SAMMISolutions/docs - the documentation website can be viewed here: https://sammi.solutions/docs/

The documentation is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license, and provides help and assistance to people using the SAMMI program. Users are allowed to make pull requests to edit the docs, and the docs are open source.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository by LioranWaters (not to be confused with [private]) contains the entirety of SAMMI Solutions Docs: https://github.com/LioranWaters/lioranboard2docs

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched the for forks and there are no forks of the LioranWaters docs repo.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GNU GPL v3

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Under the GNU GPL v3 license, it is a requirement to include a full license text, state all significant changes made to the software, make available the original source code when distributing the licensed work and include a copy of the original copyright notice.

This fork (Lioranboard2docs repo) does not fulfil these requirements. A full license text is not visible. There have been changes to the docs in the LioranWaters repo and these changes have not been documented. There is no license text in the repository, which is a direct violation of the GNU GPL v3 license. It also does not contain the any attribution to the original copyright holder.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repo should provide all necessary attribution to the original repo it was copied from, including a license text.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

Acknowledge that it is a copy of the SAMMI Solutions documentation, and that LioranWaters does not own the documentation.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

GitHub user LioranWaters.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
