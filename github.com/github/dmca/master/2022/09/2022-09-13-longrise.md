Hello Dear Github：

  It's nice to be able to use github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.
  
  I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.
  
  Before, because I didn't understand [private] law, I mistakenly linked government projects to github and made them public! But now, the company's top management found and held my criminal responsibility, saying that I leaked government secrets. I realized the seriousness of the problem and immediately removed the repo under our organization. I thought things would come to an end. The company's top management once again found a forked repo on github and immediately ordered me to delete it immediately. Therefore, I was expelled from the company! These days, I also tried various ways to contact the user, but I won't get a reply, so I hope github can help me!
  
  The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository：

Since all of the above are projects with the government, the [private] government pays special attention to similar information security, and the HTML code in the project cannot be made public. I hope github can help me delete these repositories, and I guarantee that the users of the above branches have not made any changes, so I like github to help me delete these repositories, thank you very much!
