**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Recently, we noticed that some repositories on github contain sensitive information of our company.  
After reading and understanding Github's Guide to filling a DMCA Notice, we decide to send this message. And we appreciate very much for your help and support.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We found that a few years ago, someone uploaded our company's internal code to github without authorization, the repository name contains "jce", and these repositories contain some protocols. This information belongs to Tencent. In order to prevent further spread we hope these repositories are removed as soon as possible, we tried to contact some users but got no response. There are even many repository owners left with no contact details.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
