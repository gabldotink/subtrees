I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Some guy on GitHub called "[private]" published [private] source code. He was once part of the [private], and now published the source without prior asking me.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Ok i am not sure, if i need to write about [private] original work and where [private] have it published, or if its about the illegal repository.

- He published the link to his repository on this shady website: [private]  
- He published the repository only recently (2 days ago), while this "server proxy" is part of one of [private] repositories (since [private])  
- The proof: The link to [private] private repository, where this "server proxy" is part of: [private]

This "server proxy" is used to redirect users for a game server.
