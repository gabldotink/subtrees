**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My package capacitor-updater is LGPL-3.0-only licence, and someone has publish it on npm without letting access to the code.
i tried to tell them by contacting one person on the team but i didn't get any answer.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

here is the link to the publication https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wisdomgarden/capacitor-updater where it's not possible to see the code they have publish.

my concern is in NPM : https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wisdomgarden/capacitor-updater  
that the url who is breaking the copyright of this project :  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capgo/capacitor-updater  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

in the best case it will be preferable to just let them open source the code as it should, but if they can't the best would be to remove it from npm

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

The fork is in private

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

LGPL-3.0-only now and at the time of the fork AGPL-3.0-only

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

the code modified should be published, they didn't publish, in npm it's only the code compiled.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

make they github repo as public is the best solution.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

make they github repo as public to follow agpl requirement

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

yes i did find one person of the team in twitter but, it seems no really active to maybe he never got the message.
