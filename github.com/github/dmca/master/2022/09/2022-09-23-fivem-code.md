Me and this guy used to work on a new "fivem server project" based on my old project using repo created by him. That fivem server project contains scripts mostly written in LUA language. The repo contains code written by me. I am programmer and i no longer want he to be able to use my code. The initial commit is by me and most of the commits. I have no longer access to the repo ([private]). My lawyers sent him a dmca email and he ignored it.

The infringing repository is not publicly accessible, i know about it because i was previously contributor.
