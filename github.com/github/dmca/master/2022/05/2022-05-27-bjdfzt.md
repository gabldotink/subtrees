Hello Dear Github:

We Are BeijingDFZT Inc. Official website is http://www.bjdfzt.com.cn
Its nice to be able to user Github such a professional and efficient platform,
and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support
and resolution.

We have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA
Notice.

3 years ago, In 2019 , this Email address([private] / Github public
email ) created a Repository called "[private]" ，and deleted
shortly after creation. The code of the Repository is a very important product
of our company. the product URL
is http://www.bjdfzt.com.cn/index.php?m=home&c=View&a=index&aid=25 .

But a account （like a bot account）immediately forked our entire
Repository and it still exists.

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository:
https://github.com/P79N6A/openplatform
(The red box is the repository address ，the blue box is
me :[private] , committed on [private])

This (https://github.com/P79N6A/openplatform) repository contains the
source code of our company , algorithm and
system configuration information .

So we hope Github as son as possible to help us remove "P79N6A /
openplatform" and its forks

https://github.com/kongqingbai/openplatform  
https://github.com/lai1245199086/openplatform  
https://github.com/yangxin1994/openplatform  

We have looked all forked repository , they don't operate on the code. just
copy our Repository that has been removed. So this operation has no effect
on anyone.

Thank you very much!
