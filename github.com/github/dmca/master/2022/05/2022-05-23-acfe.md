The "CFE Exam Prep Course" is a copyrighted work owned by Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, Inc. This work is comprised of hundreds of multiple-choice questions that help prepare users to take the Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) Exam. The content is not publicly posted, but information about the CFE Prep Course is available here: https://www.acfe.com/training-events-and-products/cfe-exam-preparation/cfe-exam-prep---study-on-your-own-options/cfe-exam-prep-course

The repository describes itself as: "An intelligent agent that answers questions for the Certified Fraud Examiners Exam (CFE Exam)" and it uses the above-referenced questions from the CFE Prep Course in its content. For instance, see this folder and subfolders for links to content from our copyrighted work: https://github.com/jjohnson346/cfe-exam-agent/tree/master/exam%20questions%20-%20all

(The entire repository) Explanation:

I would be happy to explain why the repository in its entirety should be taken down. The sole purpose of this program is to predict answers to my client’s CFE Exam (which, besides the copyright claims herein, would constitute cheating on a professional certification exam). You can confirm this in the “About” section of the repository: “an intelligent agent that answers questions for the Certified Fraud Examiners Exam (CFE Exam).”

 

The functionality is completely dependent on infringing on our copyrighted work, the CFE Exam Prep Course. The program functions by analyzing text of our copyrighted work to predict the answers to CFE Exam questions. Our copyrighted work is the primary textual content that is being analyzed and, therefore, essential to the functioning of this program. Additionally, portions of our work are not confined to a few files. Below is a non-exhaustive list of links that contain our copyrighted work.

It would take numerous hours to identify every link thank contains an infringement—not because they are hard to find, but because they are so numerous. This further supports the need to remove the entire repository. There is also no room for argument that this is a fair use of our materials, the use of our copyright is widespread and systematic in the program. Moreover, it would be unreasonable and burdensome for GitHub to require us to cite every file when a cursory investigation of this program would demonstrate that its core function is fundamentally dependent on infringing our copyrighted work, and that it is designed to help individuals cheat on our certification exam. Therefore, we again ask that the entire repository be removed.
