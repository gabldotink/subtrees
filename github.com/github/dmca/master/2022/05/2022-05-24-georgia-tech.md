I am part of the Georgia Tech [private], and I have found code solutions for a class at Georgia Tech. Whenever student turn into their code assignments they agree to the Georgia Tech Honor Code stating they are not cheating or allowing others to cheat by sharing Georgia Tech’s assessment materials. The assignment materials were provided to students so that they could complete their tasks and isn't to be shared with others.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repository contains code provided to complete assignments, and student agreed that the code was not to be shared when the accepted the Georgia Honor Code Agreement. The former student posted Georgia Tech source code at this URL: https://github.com/sebhollister/Computer-Vision

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
