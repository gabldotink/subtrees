Dear Team,  
  
   
  
Thank you for bringing additional forks into our attention and fast responses, here is our new notice:  
  
   
  
Notice of Infringement via Email    
Notice ID: [private]
  
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.  
  
Date: May 20, 2022, 9:02 p.m.  
github.com  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
I have taken [fair use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22) into consideration.  
  
Attention github.com:  
  
I am writing to notify you about violations of the intellectual property rights of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Blizzard”) on your service and to demand that you take immediate corrective action to cease this infringement and prevent further violations of Blizzard's rights.  
  
Blizzard holds copyrights and/or exclusive online reproduction, distribution, and public performance rights in the titles listed below, which are a representative list of the copyrighted works owned by Blizzard that are being infringed on your service.  
  
We have included below examples of locations on your service where infringing copies of the Blizzard titles are available. As you know, you are not authorized to host, distribute, or otherwise make available or facilitate the making available of any copies of Blizzard's titles on your service.  
  
Blizzard demands that you immediately and permanently remove from your service all copies of the Blizzard titles listed below. This includes the copies available at the links below as well as any other copies of these same titles that you are hosting.  
  
You can take simple steps to avoid the continuing violation of Blizzard's rights by using readily-available, industry-standard content recognition technology to prevent infringing content from being made available by your service. This technology both can prevent unauthorized uploads of copyrighted content and can ensure that the same content that has been removed from your service at the request of a copyright owner is not re-ingested by your service. See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. (2005) 545 U.S. 913, 939 fn.12 (failure to use available filtering technologies to diminish infringement is evidence of intentional facilitation of infringement).  
  
Furthermore, we expect that you are keeping track of subscribers/account holders that engage in copyright infringement and are taking appropriate action to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.  
  
This email is not a complete statement of Blizzard's rights in connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies, or defenses of Blizzard in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly reserved. I have a good faith belief that use of the works in the manner described herein is not authorized by Blizzard, its agent, or the law, and confirm under penalty of perjury that I am authorized to act on Blizzard's behalf in connection with this notice. The information in this notice is accurate.  
  
Sincerely,  
  
[private]
