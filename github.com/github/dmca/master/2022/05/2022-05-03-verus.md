**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a representative of a product known as 'Verus AntiCheat' or 'Verus' which is a proprietary cheat prevention software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work is a proprietary cheat prevention software. The original software is written in java and is not available publicly to download or view. The material posted online is a decompiled and deobfuscated version of our software which was obtained by breaking our terms of service and deliberately using a java agent to instrument and dump the software.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I would like the entire repository as well as any and all forks that relate to or are similar to the URLs and files mentioned here.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**
