I don't know who this user is but they have stolen our code somehow: https://github.com/denskorov/old_air_bit_laravel -- It's even labeled Old Airbit Laravel. This repo is a copy of our repo from 2 years ago. I'm not sure if this is related to the Heroku / Travis hack: https://www.hackread.com/github-hackers-stole-oauth-access-tokens-of-firms/ as we may have used them in the past. Either way, this is our code and it's private and it was created by Airbit. It contains sensitive information that could severely harm our business.
