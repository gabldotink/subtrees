**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
  
No  
  
**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
  
GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I'm the [private] of the design the alleged infringer stole after reverse-engineering my software.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
I [private] the software Atomic Obfuscator AKA Atomic Protector. I was a customer of the alleged infringer's authentication service and he didn't liken to the fact I often criticized his service for not providing enough to its customers. As a result, he allegedly reverse-engineered my software and allegedly leaked it as seen here https://cracked.io/Thread-Supreme-ATOMIC-PROTECTOR-LEAKED-WITH-SOURCE.  
  
It's quite evident this is allegedly the same person as the alleged infringer, as by looking at his profile [private], we can see both the alleged infringer and this profile promote their authentication service, auth.gg.  
  
You can see the image the alleged infringer allegedly posted [private] and how it allegedly nearly mirrors the design in the repository I'm requesting partial removal of.  
  
Here's a video comparing the alleged infringing portion of the repository with the design of my software [private]  
  
Additionally, as you can see in the cracked.io thread linked above, the date the alleged infringer allegedly leaked my software was 30 April, 2020. The alleged infringing portion of the repository wasn't uploaded until May 14, 2020 https://github.com/Outbuilt/Auth.GG-CSharp/commit/bfb5c1e563861e10ea2d607452cbaf2603b11f6a  
  
So, I'm requesting that the alleged infringing portion of the repository, solely this Winform Example directory https://github.com/Outbuilt/Auth.GG-CSharp/tree/master/WinForm%20Example, be committed from the repository on the basis that it allegedly violates my copyright by allegedly stealing my design work.  
  
Furthermore, I have reason to believe this has caused damages to my software, as I often get accused of stealing the alleged infringer's design, when in fact I allege it is the other way around. So, I am adamant that my copyright has been allegedly violated, and encourage the alleged infringer to use another design.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
Solely this directory https://github.com/Outbuilt/Auth.GG-CSharp/tree/master/WinForm%20Example  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
No  
  
**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
