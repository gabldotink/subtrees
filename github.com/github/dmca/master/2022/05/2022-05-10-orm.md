I created a Repository called "[private]" in "[private]" group. The Repository called "[private]" not only contained database password information, But also contained the company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal data assets. Later found that before we deleted, the user named TeaganBriggs completely forked my entire Repository, and it still exists.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I created a "[private]" Repository which URL is [private]. But It was deleted by me. But you can see the "https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm" commit log which name is [private].  
* the most of files like https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm/blob/master/cmd/add_mysql.go contained [private]".  
* https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm/blob/master/mysql.yaml contained database password information  
* https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm/blob/master/gocore.yaml contained database table structure  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following is Github's URL about my forked Repository.  
https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm
Because the most of files like https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm/blob/master/cmd/add_mysql.go contained "[private]". And https://github.com/TeaganBriggs/orm/blob/master/mysql.yaml contains the company's database password information. so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove TeaganBriggs/orm. If the Repository hasn't been removed, I'll be fired from the company. thank you very much!
