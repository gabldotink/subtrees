**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the [private] of the design the alleged infringer stole after reverse-engineering my software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

GitHub has already processed this same type of request before https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/9806e7fee17e10fb6d2b3780b5d6726e17458a5f/2022/05/2022-05-12-atomic-protector.md. However, I found more repositories that violate my copyright, so I'm making a new notice upon GitHub's request.

I [private] the software Atomic Obfuscator AKA Atomic Protector. I was a customer of the infringer's authentication service and he didn't liken to the fact I often criticized his service for not providing enough to its customers. As a result, he reverse-engineered my software and leaked it as seen here [invalid]

It's quite evident this is the same person as the infringer, as by looking at his profile [private], we can see both the infringer and this profile promote their authentication service, auth.gg.

You can see the image the infringer posted [invalid] and how it nearly mirrors the design in the repository I'm requesting partial removal of.

Here's a video comparing the infringing portion of the repository with the design of my software [invalid]

Additionally, as you can see in the cracked.io thread linked above, the date the infringer leaked my software was 30 April, 2020. The infringing portion of the repository wasn't uploaded until May 14, 2020 [private]

So, I'm requesting that the infringing portion of the repository, solely this Winform Example directory https://github.com/ZenoIDK/auth.gg-backup/tree/main/WinForm%20Example, be redacted from the repository on the basis that it violates my copyright by stealing my design work.

Furthermore, I have reason to believe this has caused damages to my software, as I often get accused of stealing the infringer's design, when in fact I it is the other way around. So, I am adamant that my copyright has been violated, and encourage the infringer to use another design.
