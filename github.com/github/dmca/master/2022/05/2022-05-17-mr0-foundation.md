Hello Dear Github:

I’m a [private] from [private] My Github account name is [private]. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.

I have read and understand Github’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I created a Repository called “[private]” in 2019, I want to study source code to no much take time, I committed source code to Github.com to I can work it from my home, which contained creators, contents and domain name([private]) are all owned by my company. Due to I’m not familiar with using github , I have set the Repository public. Recently, due to information security I have to deleted the repository, but I found the user named bellmit completely forked my entire Repository, and it still exists. It is not under an open source license. This user is in violation of the license grant to not distribute the source code as specified in the License Grant. Additionally the work is licensed under a proprietary license. And also I’ve tried to contact with the user , but I can’t found any contact information.

The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about my forked Repository:

l  https://github.com/bellmit/GlawayMRO4.1

l  [private]

[private]

 

These code belongs to my company’s product : Glaway MRO Foundation, which the copyright register num is [private]，the following is screenshots about the product:

Since “bellmit/GlawayMRO4.1” contains my company’s important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to my company’s internal data assets, so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me permanently remove bellmit/GlawayMRO4.1 and thank you very much!

The following is my and my company contact information:

l  Company Name: [private]

l  My e-mail Address： [private]

l  Cellphone: [private]

l  Company Address: [private]

l  Company Phone: [private]

l  Website: [private]

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

AND Also include the following statement:”I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act to behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”

 

Hoping for your response, and thanks again.
