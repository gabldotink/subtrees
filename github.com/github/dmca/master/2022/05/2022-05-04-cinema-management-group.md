Therefore could you make sure that it gets removed asap please.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described 
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, 
or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is 
accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf 
of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

This letter is official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c)
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") to effect removal of the
above-reported infringements. I request that you immediately issue a
cancellation message as specified in RFC 1036 for the specified postings
and prevent the infringer, who is identified by its Web address, from
posting the infringing material to your servers in the future. Please be
advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to "expeditiously
remove or disable access to" the infringing material upon receiving this
notice. Noncompliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under
the DMCA.

Best regards,

Blue Efficience
