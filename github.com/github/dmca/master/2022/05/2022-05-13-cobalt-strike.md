**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Cobalt Strike is a HelpSystems proprietary product whose business model is through licenses. The license and other information relevant to the business is contained in each copy of the product.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The license file has been bypassed and the product is being used in an unlicensed manner without purchasing it.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
