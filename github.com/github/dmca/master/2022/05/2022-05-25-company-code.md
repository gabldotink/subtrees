To Github,

My name is [private],

I found that there are one repo, the code is completely consistent with my code, I am the copyright owner of the source code , but they are infringing:

https://github.com/bellmit/Leader-care-backend

The code was uploaded to github by this account [[private]]. The user violated my company code without consent. The code is exactly the same as what I uploaded, and I did not leave contact information. I request official assistance to delete the code.We put a lot of effort into this code, and copying it to his own repository without the consent of anyone in our team will bring huge losses to our team. We implore github to urge him to delete it as soon as possible, and I put the evidence photo in the attachment , we are willing to provide any evidence that he infringes.
