The DriftV project is a resource that I created myself on my free time and published for free on github (you can follow the creation of the project by looking at the list of commits I made myself).  
Moreover, this resource was intended for the FiveM platform, I had at the time of sharing create a post on the forum also proving that I am the creator.
( https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-driftv-full-drift-based-gamemode/2903133 ).

I assure you that I am the developer who wrote each line of code of this project that I made for the community, in order to share it for free unlike the person who is now selling my code.

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I created this community project in order to share it for FREE, however some people saw it as an opportunity to make money, so they made this DMCA in order to sell my work.

This person ( https://www.dmca.com/r/13klr79 ) is currently selling my work on his website ( https://tonivsari.es/ ).

On the site you can see the "Toni-Base drift" with a video presentation. By watching the video you can clearly see my work that I made for free on github ( you can compare to the image that was present in the repo readme )

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**
