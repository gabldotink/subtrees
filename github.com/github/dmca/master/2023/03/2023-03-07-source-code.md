I have read and understood GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This is with respect to my request for disabling a repository, which has now been successfully taken down by your team. A huge thank you for that! I have attached the disablement email from Github for your reference. The link to the repository is as below - 
[invalid]  
However, I have now identified a forked repository in the below URL -https://github.com/TrellixVulnTeam/Sheersa-Mohanty_YPVX

I am raising this request to disable the forked repository since this also contains sensitive information (official email address of a company's current employee) from the parent repository. Since this is public, the company's sensitive information is also public and anyone can access this.
You may refer to one of the folders as shared in the link below -
