**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] at Columbia University and [private] at Columbia University (proof: [private]). The contents of [private] course material (especially the homeworks and exams which are private and only accessible to the current enrolled students) have been posted online in a github repo. This, of course, violates academic integrity and promotes student cheating in the future semesters and I would like this material to be taken down immediately.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All files in each of the following repos (except for the README.md files)  
https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771-Exam  
https://github.com/powcoder/COMS-4771-HW4  
https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771

There is absolutely no original student work in any of these repos.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Repo #1 https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771-Exam (contains total 3 files + README.md)  
The entire repo contains homework and exam questions (copyrighted by [private] as the [private]), there are no student solutions or any original work. In particular:  
- (private file, all questions no student answers or any original work) https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771-Exam/blob/main/Exam2_COMS4771_S21.pdf.pdf  
- (private file, all questions no student answers or any original work) https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771-Exam/blob/main/ml_fi_fa2017.pdf  
- (private file, all questions no student answers or any original work) https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771-Exam/blob/main/ml_hw4.pdf

The entire repo should be taken down.

Repo #2 https://github.com/powcoder/COMS-4771-HW4 (contains total 1 file + README.md)  
The entire repo contains homework questions (copyrighted by [private] as the [private]), there are no student solutions or any original work. In particular:  
- (private file, all questions no student answers or any original work) https://github.com/powcoder/COMS-4771-HW4/blob/main/ml_fa2021_hw4.pdf

The entire repo should be taken down.

Repo #3 https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771 (contains 40 files + README.md)  
Every single file is taken from [private] class website and already appears here: [private]  
Few examples:  
- https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771/blob/main/lec1_intro_mle_bayes_naive_evaluation.pdf
appears here: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/classes/ml/lec/lec1_intro_mle_bayes_naive_evaluation.pdf  
- https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771/blob/main/lec2_nn_improve_decision_trees.pdf
appears here: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/classes/ml/lec/lec2_nn_improve_decision_trees.pdf  
- https://github.com/powcoder/COMS4771/blob/main/lec3_linperceptron_kern.pdf
appears here: https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/classes/ml/lec/lec3_linperceptron_kern.pdf  

Again, the entire repo should be taken down

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] course material (homeworks and exams) is only accessible to the currently enrolled students for a limited time. After that we revoke everyone's access to maintain academic integrity. Students are also given explicit instructions and sign a pledge to not share or post the material online.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The github account https://github.com/powcoder is a homework solving service and is known to promote cheating. Most likely some of the enrolled students used this service for "help" solving the homeworks/exams questions. By posting the private material, this service is likely promoting (via github and other channels) that they can provide "help" with this type of material.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As far as we have checked, there are the subsequent folks of the infringing files/repos.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

All information we have is from https://github.com/powcoder

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
