**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Earlier versions of the ShortLook software (here, 1.0.4) included measures to ensure that the device/user running the software matched that which downloaded the software, which could at the time only be done by purchasing or receiving as a gift via the Dynastic Repo website.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

It is my understanding that the infringing distributions of the ShortLook software marked 1.0.4 have been patched to bypass such checks.

Because they are wholesale redistributions of binaries with minor patches to disable code, while the technical measures were in some of the cases bypassed, the main complaint here is the distribution of copyrighted content rather than any circumvention of protections.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

Yes, N/A

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
