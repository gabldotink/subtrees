Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

All the source code of the mentioned information systems is stored in a private git repository, owned by the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil and access to the source code, through a personal username and password, was granted only to developers who might be working in the respective projects.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Probably the persons responsible for publishing the source code were developers hired to work on projects maintained by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. We looked for forks of the projects listed above and none were found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The persons responsible for the publication are the github.com users identified as "davidjeremias" and "Tauser". By coincidence (or not), we found that [private] and [private] provided services in the development of said information systems through [private], signed with the company [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
