This project is an APP-side H5 project under provincial government units in China. It contains sensitive information such as user login, basic information of developers and partners contained in the source code, and path and API of related data interface requests are all exposed directly to the source code. If published on GitHub by open source, it will be attacked in different situations. It's a big blow to the whole project and to the business, and the costs are quite expensive, so without widespread awareness at the moment, I really hope that the authorities will write off the entire warehouse right away, and then it's impossible to imagine.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The above is the warehouse address for the suspected theft of company source code, because it is a complete project and I would like to delete it entirely, but we cannot contact the author at this time, so we can only bother the authorities to delete it.
