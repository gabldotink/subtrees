**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We (iSoftStone Information Technology (Group) Co., Ltd. ) are the vendor of Amway corporation inc. and we developed Amway's ECard feature, whose source code has been leaked on GitHub without authorization.  
We have office in US (Seattle & New York) while customer Amway is headquartered in US too. However this project took place in China by an off-shore team.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Reclaim: I can't provide any URL, becuase it's internally used, not a web site.

The work is mostly a back-end service, won't work without proper front end call attempt.  
And due to security concerns the actual deployment address cannot be disclosed.  
out of a quick search of keyword "amway" or "ecard" in code files you can see hundreds of hit:
