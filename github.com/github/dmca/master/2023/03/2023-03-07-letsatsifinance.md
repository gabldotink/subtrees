I have read and understood Github's guide to filing a DMCA notice and would like to report the work on a Github user's repository (Sundayezekiel83). We cannot make direct contact with the users as their contact details are not publicly available.

The user's repository (Sundayezekiel83/landingPage) is a literal copy of the web code of our compay's website (https://www.letsatsifinance.co.za/).  
This user has made the repository public on Github, which poses a further risk to the access of our intellectual property.

Sundayezekiel83 needs to Immediately remove the repository and all parts relating to our website on any of their projects.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or law.

Yes I have searched for Forks and I cannot find any that are identical to our code.
