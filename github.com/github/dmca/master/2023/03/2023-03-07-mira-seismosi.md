After some investigation, it looks like one of our previous developer has decided to publish the code in public repository.

I was contacted by one of my client ( Mirai) that his site has been compromised, that a AWS key was exposed in GitHub public repo.  
[private]  
This forced AWS to shutdown the account.

This Developer (dmytyatsenko) used to work for us (Data Sleek) on 2 projects: Mirai and Seismos.

As you can see if this 2 private repo, our new developer has been pushing code recently.

This developer was from [private]  
[private]  
His profile seems to have been terminated on [private]) [private].  
And he seem to have posted these repository on GitHub recently.

Upon terminating our contract with us, where he had overcharged us and we were disputing the number of hours, he threaten us to release code to Public domain. (Back in January). We paid him, and had to lower our invoices towards our clients. We thought we were done with him but apparently he might have wanted to retaliate once his [private] profile was terminated.

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Developers are added as collaborators because they're working remotely.  
Developers need to download the code locally to their Desktop in order to develop.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

I'm not sure I understand the question here.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

So far this is the only one I could found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
