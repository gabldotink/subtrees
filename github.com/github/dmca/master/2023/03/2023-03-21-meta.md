Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 403 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

VIA EMAIL: Notice of Claimed Infringement via Email  
URL: http://www.github.com  
DATE: 03/20/2023

Dear github.com,

We are writing this letter on behalf of Meta Platforms, Inc.

We have received information leading us to believe that the website located at http://www.github.com (the "Website") is hosting and/or facilitating the downloading and/or streaming of content (listed below) in which Meta is the copyright owner and/or the owner of exclusive rights in such content (the "Meta Properties"). No one is authorized to exhibit, reproduce, transmit, or otherwise distribute Meta Properties without the express written permission of Meta, and the unauthorized distribution of Meta Properties constitutes copyright infringement or improper/unauthorized use. This conduct may also violate the laws of other countries, international law, and/or treaty obligations.

1. Identification of Meta Properties:  
LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) - https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/

2. Infringing material or activity found at the following location(s):

http://github.com/shawwn/llama-dl

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

We have a good faith belief that use of the Meta Properties materials described above on the Website is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Accordingly, Meta requests that http://www.github.com immediately cease access to the Meta Properties in connection with the Website, and further requests that http://www.github.com confirms in writing to the undersigned that (i) access to the Meta Properties has been removed and that (ii) appropriate actions have been taken against the account holder under your Abuse Policy/Terms of Service Agreement.

The information in this notice is accurate and we state, under penalty of perjury, that we are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

This letter is not a complete statement of Meta's rights in connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights or remedies of Meta in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly reserved.

We appreciate your assistance and thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Any further inquiries can be directed to [private]. Please include this message with your inquiry to ensure a quick response.

Sincerely,
