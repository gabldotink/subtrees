1) An explicit statement that you would like to retract all or part of your notice.
I did that but I will try again here.

I explicitly want to retract my DMCA takedown request of this repository  https://github.com/K07H/QModManager  
2) Links to the specific files that were disabled.  
As you disabled his whole repo the link is  https://github.com/K07H/QModManager but in my request I only asked for  https://github.com/K07H/QModManager/releases/tag/Living-Large-update  
3) Your physical or electronic signature.
