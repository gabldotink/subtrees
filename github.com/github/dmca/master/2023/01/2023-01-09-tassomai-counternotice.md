**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I Fully own all copyright to all content currently accessible to users on the Github Repository. I Own the content, including all source code contained on the repository as i have written the program myself, and users cannot access the alleged infringing content through my program, only through an actively logged on web client via the content holder's website. The repository currently does not redistribute Intellectual property or has any intentions of redistribute Intellectual property on this platform. The repository only contains my work, including intellectual property belonging to myself, rather than content belonging to the party making the allegations.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I wish to inform you that the repository was previously targeted by the content owner and appropriate measures were taken to respect their intellectual property. Since implementing these changes, the repository has not hosted any infringing content. The DMCA Takedown Strike appears to be an unfounded attempt to remove my content from the platform, as the repository does not contain any of the content owner's property.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
