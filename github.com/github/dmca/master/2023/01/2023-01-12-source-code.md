Dear Copyright Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention an instance of copyright infringement that has occurred on your platform.

A user by the name of 39x has published a repository on GitHub under the name GameBot, which contains source code that belongs to me. This code is for a [private] bot that I own and developed. The code, including all the assets, was taken from my servers, where it was being hosted. I had made an announcement when the tragedy happened and I have attached an image of the same. I am the [private] of this code and I have not given this user permission to reproduce, distribute, or display it publicly. I can show timestamps of the bot using the images sent by the bot in different [private] servers.

I have attached images of the older versions of the files on my PC, as well as two older versions of one of the main file, as evidence of [private] authorship.  
Repository URL: https://github.com/39x/GameBot
