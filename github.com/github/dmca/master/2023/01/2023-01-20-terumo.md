Dear GitHub, we have a previous employee who accidentally checked in his local repositories to a personal GitHub account.  
Talking with [private] he is unable to delete the repositories as they are linked to his Terumo email account and he is no longer an employee. They are not part of our [private] organization but are Terumo BCT code base and this represents a security concern.
Could you please remove the repositories under https://github.com/ebadusb [github.com]  
• devops-kubernetes-cluster https://github.com/ebadusb/devops-kubernetes-cluster [github.com]  
• Common https://github.com/ebadusb/Common [github.com]  
• Trima_12.4 https://github.com/ebadusb/Trima_12.4 [github.com]  
• embedded_test https://github.com/ebadusb/embedded_test [github.com]  
• Install https://github.com/ebadusb/Install [github.com]  
• Trima_Languages https://github.com/ebadusb/Trima_Languages [github.com]  

You can see that [private] was a user in the [private] organization until he left the company in [private] and that all of these repositories stem from our organization.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.  
Thanks,  
[private]

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

All repositories are Private and internal. [private] was part of [private] and had admin rights to the repository.
After discussion with him on [private] he said the fork was a mistake during a migration of the Trima legacy code from [private] to [private].
[private] access to his Terumo email is the issue and there isn't any dispute that [private] owns the code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

As stated above [private] was an employee and had access to the code and the fork of the code base and creation of a copy in his private GitHub account was accidental. [private] has abandoned his account in GitHub and no longer has access to it.
