**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] of Epic Games, Inc. Epic Games, Inc. retains copyrights in their code, including Unreal Engine and related software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is code intended for use with the software, Unreal Engine. Information and resources for Unreal Engine can be found here:

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Unreal Engine code is governed by the terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement, which can be found at https://www.unrealengine.com/eula.

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement state that public distribution of Unreal Engine mods or source code must take place through either the Marketplace or through a fork of Epic's UnrealEngine Network.

The identified repository distributes Unreal Engine source code not through the Marketplace or through a fork of Epic's UnrealEngine Network. This violates the terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The repository distributes Unreal Engine source code in violation of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement, and so the entire repository should be removed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
