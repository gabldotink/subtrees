Discussing a repository called reputationdev/FireFly, the owner gave ownership to a user ([private]), who then sold it to another user, ([private]), who has authorized me to file the complaint, as ownership was sold, including copyright, and now the old owner is posting all of the code for free, violating our copyright

Posted there, reputation, who posted a screenshot of "proof" that they are allowed to, in the readme, but both accounts in the screenshot ([private] and [private]) are owned by the same person. The owner ([private] / [private]) gave ownership to a user ([private]), who then sold it to another user, ([private]).
