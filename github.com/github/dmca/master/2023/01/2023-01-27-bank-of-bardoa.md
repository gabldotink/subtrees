**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We want to specify the removal of the Bank of Baroda artwork used in his UI which is found in the UI folder as the developer is not authorized to use our client's intellectual property; this will cause confusion and misrepresentation as this project may be passed off and advertised as a Bank of Baroda-approved project. Our client does not want their brand name associated with this project. Hence, they requested the repository be removed as soon as possible.

Please understand Bank of Baroda has not given permission to the developer to use the copyrighted work under any circumstances and must abide by the copyright owners restriction. We are not asking for the full repository to be removed, but only the UI folder and it’s contents which contain the artwork.
