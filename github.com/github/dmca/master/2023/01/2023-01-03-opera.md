Opera Norway AS recently became aware that source code from our legacy browser engine, Presto, has appeared in GitHub. This code is the property of Opera and has been published illegally and without our permission. The Opera Presto source code was first uploaded on GitHub in 2017, but was taken down after Opera's DMCA request on January 13, 2017.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The snapshot of Presto engine code that has been published was used in Opera’s browsers up until 2013. The code contains a copyright header, that Opera is the copyright holder. Therefore, copying, reproduction, plagiarism, distribution, and/or public communication made without authorization from Opera contravenes the provisions of Directive 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market as well as the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
