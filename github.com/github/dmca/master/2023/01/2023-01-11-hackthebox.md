The original work is a hands-on penetration testing lab that we created. It is a piece of proprietary educational content used to help train penetration testers.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This is not a piece of code, but rather a whole website with writeups hosted on the above GitHub repository which contains the proprietary solutions to our lab environment. It is a step-by-step guide of exactly how to solve the labs. This includes both confidential information about the internals of the lab environments as well as precise solutions.

As we are an educational/training content provider, the document linked above directly infringes upon our copyrighted intellectual property.

The user has a htb folder in his repo where he publishes the writeups for active content, which you can find here https://github.com/meowmeowattack/meowmeowattack.github.io/tree/main/htb.

The following links are against our TOS. The specific part is his:

Users must not share in any way any of the “solutions” to the “machines” or "challenges" included in the WEBSITE, save the retired ones.  
Users must not share in any way any of the “solutions” to the “pro labs” included in the WEBSITE.
