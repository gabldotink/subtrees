**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the base code that is used in the provided repositories.
This encompasses the entire solutions, which are given to students to work from. Therefore, code which should not be shared is present across the entire repository (in each case).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The work is a University coursework which is based on a framework created by me at the University of Hull. This framework is my copyright IP and is not to be made publicly available. This restriction is made clear to the students. The original codebase is not freely available and a public repository can cause cheating amongst other students. The individual is allowed to make a private repository and share this privately (e.g. through a CV) but should not publish this publicly as this may impact future students.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
