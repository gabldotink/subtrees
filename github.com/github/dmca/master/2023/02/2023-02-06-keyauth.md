**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and the [private] of the authentication software seen at https://keyauth.cc and https://github.com/KeyAuth

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The C++ SDK https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example and accompanying C++ library https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library for my software have been stolen and used in a competitor's code without my authorization.

First off, the [private] is the same in his SLN file https://github.com/AuthCord/authcord-cpp/blob/main/Authcord-Example.sln as my SLN file https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/example.sln. Meaning, he copied my project file and just renamed it to the name of his software, "authcord".

Next, he's copied my instance name format. Mine is "KeyAuthApp" seen here https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/eee2ddf2b68bd096ab25af58a27fb3d2bba365ad/main.cpp#L27, his is "AuthcordApp" seen here https://github.com/AuthCord/authcord-cpp/blob/ba01d85020665e76195061cae7a1e5709ce80a3e/Authcord-Example/Authcord-Example.cpp#L22

He's also stolen my exact class structure, visible here https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/eee2ddf2b68bd096ab25af58a27fb3d2bba365ad/main.cpp#L104 and here https://github.com/AuthCord/authcord-cpp/blob/ba01d85020665e76195061cae7a1e5709ce80a3e/Authcord-Example/Authcord-Example.cpp#L42

Then, he also copied my includes in the header file of his repository, see https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example/blob/main/auth.hpp and https://github.com/AuthCord/authcord-cpp/blob/main/Authcord-Example/Authcord.hpp. He has absolutely 0 use for vector and fstream. These libraries are used for the std::vector data type and for writing/reading files. He is doing neither of these in his project, so it's evident that he just stole my code and didn't even evaluate it to remove redundant libraries.

Lastly, if you view the contents of https://github.com/AuthCord/authcord-cpp/blob/main/Authcord-Example/Authcord-Lib.lib, you'll see the following file paths:

C:\Users\[private]\Desktop\Authcord C-Lib\Authcord-cppLib\Authcord-Lib\Security.hpp  
C:\Users\[private]\Desktop\Authcord C-Lib\Authcord-cppLib\Authcord-Lib\xorstr.hpp

These match file names in my C++ library; https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library/blob/main/Security.hpp & https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library/blob/main/xorstr.hpp

This all amounts to blatant infringement of my copyright. I'm utilizing the Elastic License 2.0 which prohibits competitors from utilizing my code. I request complete removal of the repository and fork(s).
