While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Contents of this repository include articles and code that used to belong to my personal blog site. And I am the [private] of these contents.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I used to write some technical articles. These contents used to be on my own cloud server, but once I accidently uploaded them to github pages in a public repository. Those uploaded content contains some of my personal privacy information, which should not be uploaded to a public repository. There is also a statement in the repository that unauthorized reprints of those contents is not allowed, but someone ignores the statement and forked the repository. When I realized the problem, I immediately deleted my own public repo, but unfortunately there was another one fork of the repo that contains my personal privacy and infringed contents.

These files include my name:
https://github.com/lichao20000/ciyaz.github.io/blob/master/%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF/%E8%BA%AB%E4%BB%BD%E8%AE%A4%E8%AF%81/CAS%E5%8D%95%E7%82%B9%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95/CAS%E5%8D%95%E7%82%B9%E7%99%BB%E5%BD%95.md (line 300)
