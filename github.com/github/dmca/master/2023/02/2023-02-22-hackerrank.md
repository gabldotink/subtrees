I, [private], certify under penalty of perjury that I am an employee authorized by Interviewstreet Incorporated d/b/a HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/) to act on its behalf and to submit this DMCA takedown notice. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to File a DMCA Notice.

Hackerrank creates unique technical assessments that help its partners assess developers. These are proprietary technical assessments and their accompanying solutions that have been copied from our platform without authorization. The hosted content is a direct and literal copy of Hackerrank’s works. Hackerrank is the exclusive rights holder for the infringing content and works hosted on GitHub. For convenience, I have included a table below detailing these instances of infringement:
