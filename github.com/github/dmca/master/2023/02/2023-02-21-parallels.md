Corel | Claimed Copyright Infringement Notification | https://github.com/utsanjan/PD-Runner

Dear Sirs,

 

We are a Corporation Service Company (CSC), a leading provider of brand protection and internet monitoring services. We have been authorised by our client, Corel Corporation and its subsidiaries (hereafter as “Corel”), to take action in relation to internet matters that infringe their Intellectual Property Rights (hereafter as “IPR”) and online reputation. Please review the attached Letter of Authorisation (which has been obfuscated for privacy reasons).

 

Our client is a well-known Canadian software company specialising in graphics processing. It is known for producing software titles such as CorelDRAW and acquiring brands such as Parallels, AfterShot Pro, PaintShop Pro, Painter, Video Studio, and WordPerfect. Corel primarily operates from its official websites https://www.corel.com/ and https://www.parallels.com/.

 

It was brought to our attention that one of your users on your platform is offering for download a cracked version of the Parallels Desktop software together with instructions on how to bypass the software trial expiration period. The illegal download utilises our client’s copyright without any authorisation; and, our client confirms that the offering of a download and instructions of the cracked software is not in any way authorised.

 

Additionally, the download page misuses out client’s registered “PARALLELS” trade marks throughout the resolving content without any authorisation. Such conduct creates the impression that this is legitimate software approved by Parallels, which is false and untrue. In addition, there is a concern that the illegally cracked software might potentially be a security risk to users.

 

We, therefore, would appreciate your cooperation in removing the download page for the cracked software (listed below) on the basis of infringement of our client’s IPR.

 

Please find below information to process our IPR complaint:
