Dear GitHub Inc.,

I am writing to request the immediate removal of the infringing material located at https://github.com/MonkeyWhisper/ls-mdt. This material infringes on the copyrights of 0Resmon.

I am the [private] of the exclusive rights to the copyrighted work, or I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I declare that I am the owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I request that you immediately remove or disable access to the infringing material.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

The entire material of the repository is infringing. The entire code is sold through the tebex.io platform as our open-source software.
This code and product can be used for personal use only. It cannot be used for commercial purposes and cannot be shared for free.
The product codes and visual materials are registered in the name of "0RESMON" (RES SOFTWARE HARDWARE TEXTILE INDUSTRY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TRADE LIMITED COMPANY) under DMCA and Turkish Patent Institute and all rights are reserved and confidential.
If the repository and forks are not removed, we will initiate the necessary legal actions.

Searching [private] will be sufficient.

The shared repository clearly acknowledges that they have purchased and shared via Tebex, as stated on the page https://github.com/MonkeyWhisper/ls-mdt#readme,

They sarcastically confess with the following writings (https://github.com/MonkeyWhisper/ls-mdt#readme);

[private]  

Additionally, the claim made in the readme is completely false, they themselves leaked our code and there is no similarity between the two codes at all! We do not violate any license, but they are violating our rights by leaking our code.

At least, in order to prevent the spread of codes, we request the removal of repositories and forks that publish our codes until the case is concluded.
Otherwise, Github will continue to assist in code leaks. It is clearly evident that Github is an open-source code sharing platform.
Sharing leaked codes is illegal and now you, Github, are responsible for the allegations of code leaks, please take action!

We request that it be completely removed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
