Tell the Truth. The DMCA requires that you swear to your counter notice under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liabilityâ€”that is, you could get sued for money damages.  
  
First, this section here. It clearly states that you must tell the truth and the person who has submitted this DMCA has lied under perjury and they continue to lie we will start legal actions. I will provide further information here below how they have committed perjury.   
  
"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice."

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled  
  
Note: This wasn't a mistake. This person is clearly trying to DMCA our work. Let's break this down. Here is out LEGIT DMCA notice [private] 
  
As you can see, it has been protected for nearly [private]. Theirs, is barely 1 week old, a fake DMCA.   
  
In their DMCA as well the questions asks  
  
"Is the work licensed under an open source license?  
  
No"  
  
And yes it does, this company has copied our UI and code located here - [private] The repo has a GPVL3 license that states it's open source and the code must be available and never encrypted. They sell it open source and I bought it, and I released it, because they used our original repo UI (see pictures on the read me of the repo and compare to theirs).   
  
Therefore because this is a clearly a copy of our repo [private] and they admitted that they have used our code   
  
[private]
  
Per image above, you can clearly see they admitting to using our UI and per them they can use it for commercial use, which is true under the license. The license also allows us to pretty much redistribute the work. It works both way.   
  
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person
