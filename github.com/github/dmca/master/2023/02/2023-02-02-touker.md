Hello Dear Github:

I am [private], a personal developer.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform,and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I created a Repository name is touker six years ago.  
Later found that before we deleted,the user named sigongli completely forked our entire Repository,and it still exists.  
The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository

â€¢ https://github.com/sigongli/touker.git

Since "touker" contains the company's important source code,algorithm and system configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove sigongli/touker and thank you very much!.

The following is our contact information:  
My Name: [private]
