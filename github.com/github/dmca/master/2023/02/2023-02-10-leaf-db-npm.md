**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

Yes

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

npm.js

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright holder of the copyrighted material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My package is called leaf-db. It's a TypeScript-based database package which I personally use for other projects. It is licensed under the GPL 3.0 license.

GitHub link: https://github.com/chronoDave/leaf-db  
npm link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaf-db

The infringed work specifically copied parts of an older version of my code (6.1.2), which can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/chronoDave/leaf-db/tree/d60835d9c39f23b6ad14217d43c970e2ca331a76

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Infringing package url (NPM): https://www.npmjs.com/package/akivadb

Unfortunately, the GitHub link on the NPM package page points to a 404, so the infringing file locations will be described as a path where https://www.npmjs.com/package/akivadb?activeTab=explore is the path's root.

akivadb / src / errors.ts => https://github.com/chronoDave/leaf-db/blob/d60835d9c39f23b6ad14217d43c970e2ca331a76/src/errors.ts

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As far as I can tell there are no forks made of my code.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GPL-3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

According to https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)

- State changes (there's no public repository)  
- Disclose source (there's no credits in the code, README or package.json)  
- Include license (license has been changed)  
- Include copyright (hasn't propagated license requirements)  

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

1) Adding appropriate attribution (mentioning my GitHub username, project name and preferably a link to my code)  
2) Changing the BSD 3-Clause license to GPL-3.0  
3) Make the repository publicly available

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

Make the project compliant as mentioned above:

1) Adding appropriate attribution (mentioning my GitHub username and preferably a link to my code)  
2) Changing the BSD 3-Clause license to GPL-3.0  
3) Make the repository publicly available  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not. I've looked in the package.json, on the GitHub profile and their Twitter but have not found a way to contact the person outside of publicly mentioning about this issue, which I deemed inappropriate.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
