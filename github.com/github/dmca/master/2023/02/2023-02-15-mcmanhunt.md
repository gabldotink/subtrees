I'm MCManhunt Company [private] that manages [private] and [private]. I was authorized to handle the case of recent leaks of our codebase including taking down unauthorized copies.

[private] - v3 codebase  
[private] - v2 codebase

Arthurr0 was a developer who was working in our company mainly on v3 codebase, but also reviewed v2 codebase. Both sides had signed NDA agreement. Unluckily he was fired few months ago. Recently someone put both versions on anonfiles and send link to some persons on discord while also having a link in bio. After contacting with him, he told us (also proving with screenshosts) that arthurr0 added him to v3 latest repository copy.  
On screenshot 1 we can see person who was partially responsible for this event send a proof (also shown more clearly on screenshot 2) that person with name "arthurr0" have a repository with last version of v3 codebase, which seems to be taken copy of original v3 codebase. According to his NDA signed with us, there are crucial points which are:
"The Employee acknowledges and agrees that all rights, title, and interest in any
Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Employer."
which proves our ownership of code and
"The Employee agrees that, upon written request of the Employer, or if they cease to
require the use of the Confidential Information, or upon expiration or termination of
this Agreement, they will turn over all documents, or other material in their
possession or control of."
After being fired he was told to delete all documents and codebases related to our company. As we was able to recently see he didn't deleted all copies of codebase - created private repository with it's copy.
To summarize everything:
- This repository took huge part in leaking our codebase with intention to do it. (arthurr0 added to repository person who was directly responsible for leaking codebase, while knowing what his intentions are)
- Didn't return (in this case delete his own copies) codebase to our company. He intentionally kept it as private repository.
