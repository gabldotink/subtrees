actor-framework
------------------------------------------
An Open Source Implementation of the Actor Model in C++

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.4.6-1
  libcaf0.18.7-0.18.7-1bl1
  libgcc1-11.3.0-1
  libssl1.1-1.1.1t-1
  libstdc++6-11.3.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.40-1
  cmake-3.23.2-1
  cygport-0.36.0-1
  gcc-core-11.3.0-1
  gcc-g++-11.3.0-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack actor-framework-0.18.7-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./actor-framework-0.18.7-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/actor-framework-0.18.7-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/actor-framework-0.18.7-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf0.18.7-0.18.7-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf-devel-0.18.7-X.tar.xz
