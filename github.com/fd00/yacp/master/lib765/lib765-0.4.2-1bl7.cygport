SUMMARY="The floppy controller emulation from JOYCE"
DESCRIPTION="Lib765 is the floppy controller emulation from JOYCE, separately packaged. It
is (in some sense) the reverse of LibDsk; it converts uPD765a commands into
LibDsk API calls. It should come in handy if you're writing a PCW, CPC or
Spectrum+3 emulator; if you want to use it in a PC emulator, you'll need to
add features such as DMA."
