SUMMARY="Easy to use, portable, open source library for system logging"
DESCRIPTION="Liblogging offers an enhanced replacement for the syslog() call, but retains
its ease of use. In a nutshell, it permits sytem administrators to direct
application log output to different destinations without requiring the app
developer to do any work for this. Liblogging is released under a 2-clause BSD
license and as such can be used in any application."
