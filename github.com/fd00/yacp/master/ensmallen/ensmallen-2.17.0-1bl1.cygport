SUMMARY="Flexible C++ library for efficient mathematical optimization"
DESCRIPTION="ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and
cutting-edge optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical
optimization task. These include full-batch gradient descent techniques,
small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and constrained
optimization."
