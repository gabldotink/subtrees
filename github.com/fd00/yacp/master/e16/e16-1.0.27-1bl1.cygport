CATEGORY="X11"
SUMMARY="Predecessor of the current E24 Enlightenment Window Manager"
DESCRIPTION="E16 is predecessor of the current E24 Enlightenment Window Manager, which is
rather complete rewrite than incremental update of E16. Although most of the
current development focus goes to E24, E16 is still under independent active
development and some users prefer it to E24. In this sense E16 will keep its
name while incrementing the versions from 1.0.0 unlike the mainstream
Enlightenment manager, which is likely going to increment its E-suffix number.
This page should summarize the links related to E16."
