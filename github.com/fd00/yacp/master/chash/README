chash
------------------------------------------
Consistent hashing is a scheme that provides hash table functionality in a way
that the addition or removal of one slot does not significantly change the
mapping of keys to slots. In contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a
change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped. By
using consistent hashing, only K/n keys need to be remapped on average, where
K is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots.

CHash is Dailymotion's implementation of consistent hashing, available as a
light and fast C library (both static and shared objects provided), with PHP
and Python bindings.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack chash-1.0.2-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./chash-1.0.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/chash-1.0.2-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/chash-1.0.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libchash1-1.0.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libchash-devel-1.0.2-X.tar.xz
