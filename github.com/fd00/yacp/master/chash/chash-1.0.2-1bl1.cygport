SUMMARY="Very fast consistent hashing library"
DESCRIPTION="Consistent hashing is a scheme that provides hash table functionality in a way
that the addition or removal of one slot does not significantly change the
mapping of keys to slots. In contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a
change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped. By
using consistent hashing, only K/n keys need to be remapped on average, where
K is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots.

CHash is Dailymotion's implementation of consistent hashing, available as a
light and fast C library (both static and shared objects provided), with PHP
and Python bindings."
