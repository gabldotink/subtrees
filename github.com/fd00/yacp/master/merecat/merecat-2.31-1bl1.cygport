SUMMARY="Small and made-easy HTTP/HTTPS server based on Jef Poskanzer's thttpd"
DESCRIPTION="Merecat started out as a pun at Mongoose, but is now useful for actual web
serving purposes. It is however not a real Meerekat, merely yet another
copycat, forked from the great thttpd created by Jef Poskanzer."
