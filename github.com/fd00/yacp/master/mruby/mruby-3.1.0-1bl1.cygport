SUMMARY="Lightweight Ruby"
DESCRIPTION="mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to
(part of) the ISO standard. mruby can be linked and embedded within your
application. We provide the interpreter program 'mruby' and the interactive
mruby shell 'mirb' as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into
compiled byte code using the mruby compiler 'mrbc'. All those tools reside in
'bin' directory. The 'mrbc' is also able to generate compiled byte code in a C
source file. You can check the 'mrbtest' program under the 'test' directory."
