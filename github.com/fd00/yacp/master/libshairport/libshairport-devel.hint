ldesc: "This is a fork of ShairPort written by James Laird
<jhl@mafipulation.org>. The original maintainer of ShairPort had said that he
intended version 0.05 to be his last release (announcement can be found at
http://mafipulation.org/blagoblig/reversing). Therefore, the XBMC team decided
to fork ShairPort and make it into a library (libshairport) for use with XBMC."
