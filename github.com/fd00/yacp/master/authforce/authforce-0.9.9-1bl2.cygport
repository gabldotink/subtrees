SUMMARY="HTTP authentication brute forcer"
DESCRIPTION="Authforce is an HTTP authentication brute forcer. Using various methods, it
attempts brute force username and password pairs for a site. It has the
ability to try common username and passwords, username derivations, and
common username/password pairs. It is used to both test the security of your
site and to prove the insecurity of HTTP authentication based on the fact that
users just donâ€™t pick good passwords."
