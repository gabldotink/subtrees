SUMMARY="Generic Mapping Tools"
DESCRIPTION="GMT is an open-source collection of command-line tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting,
gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations ranging
from simple xâ€“y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces
and 3D perspective views. It supports many map projections and transformations
and includes supporting data such as coastlines, rivers, and political
boundaries and optionally country polygons."
