SUMMARY="Align long and short reads to redundant sequence databases"
DESCRIPTION="KMA is a mapping method designed to map raw reads directly against redundant
databases, in an ultra-fast manner using seed and extend. KMA is particulary
good at aligning high quality reads against highly redundant databases, where
unique matches often does not exist. It works for long low quality reads as
well, such as those from Nanopore. Non-unique matches are resolved using the
ConClave sorting scheme, and a consensus sequence are outputtet in addition to
other common attributes, based on our users demands."
