SUMMARY="x86 Disassembler Library"
DESCRIPTION="The libdisasm library provides basic disassembly of Intel x86 instructions
from a binary stream. The intent is to provide an easy to use disassembler
which can be called from any application; the disassembly can be produced in
AT&T syntax and Intel syntax, as well as in an intermediate format which
includes detailed instruction and operand type information."
