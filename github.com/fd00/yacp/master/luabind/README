luabind
------------------------------------------
Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua. It has
the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to Lua. It will
also supply the functionality to define classes in Lua and let them derive from
other Lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can override virtual functions
from their C++ base classes. It is written towards Lua 5.0, and does not work
with Lua 4.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-2.10.0-1
  libgcc1-6.4.0-5
  libluabind-devel-0.9.1+git20150408-1bl1
  libluabind0-0.9.1+git20150408-1bl1
  libstdc++6-6.4.0-5
  lua-5.2.4-1
  pkg-config-0.29.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cmake-3.6.2-1
  cygport-0.31.0-1
  gcc-core-6.4.0-5
  gcc-g++-6.4.0-5
  lua-5.2.4-1
  make-4.2.1-2

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/luabind-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libluabind0-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libluabind-devel-0.9.1+git20150408-X.tar.xz
