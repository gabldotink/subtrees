SUMMARY="Icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite"
DESCRIPTION="fIcy is a small icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite for use under shell
environment. Its goal is to automatically rip a stream into user customisable
files. It will work with ICY compatible streams, allowing you to either to
save the stream to disk or to pipe the output to a media player, or even both.
fIcy, among other uses, is ideal for batch/unattended recording of radio
programs and stream debugging."
