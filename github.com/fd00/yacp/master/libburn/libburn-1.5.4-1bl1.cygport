SUMMARY="Library for reading, mastering and writing optical discs"
DESCRIPTION="Libburn is a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media:
CD, DVD and BD (Blu-Ray). It also offers a facility for reading data blocks
from its drives without using the normal block device I/O, which has
advantages and disadvantages. It seems appropriate, nevertheless, to do
writing and reading via same channel. On several Linux systems, the block
device driver needs reloading of the drive tray in order to make available
freshly written data. The libburn read function does not need such a reload.
The code of libburn is independent of cdrecord."
