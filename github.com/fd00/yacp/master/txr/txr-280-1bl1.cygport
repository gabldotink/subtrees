SUMMARY="Programming language for convenient data munging"
DESCRIPTION="TXR is a pragmatic, convenient tool ready to take on your daily hacking
challenges with its dual personality: its whole-document pattern matching and
extraction language for scraping information from arbitrary text sources, and
its powerful data-processing language to slice through problems like a hot
knife through butter. Many tasks can be accomplished with TXR one liners
directly from your system prompt. TXR is relatively new: the project started
in 2009."
