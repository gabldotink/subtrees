SUMMARY="GNU GLOBAL source code tag system"
DESCRIPTION="GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way across
diverse environments (emacs, vi, less, bash, web browser, etc). You can locate
symbols in source files and move there easily. It is useful for hacking a
large project containing many sub-directories, many #ifdef and many main()
functions. It is similar to ctags or etags but is different from them at the
point of independence of any editor."
