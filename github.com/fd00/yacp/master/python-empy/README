python-empy
------------------------------------------
EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements in template
text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and produces output. This is
accomplished via expansions, which are special signals to the EmPy system and
are set off by a special prefix (by default the at sign, @). EmPy can expand
arbitrary Python expressions and statements in this way, as well as a variety
of special forms. Textual data not explicitly delimited in this way is sent
unaffected to the output, allowing Python to be used in effect as a markup
language. Also supported are callbacks via hooks, recording and playback via
diversions, and dynamic, chainable filters. The system is highly configurable
via command line options and embedded commands.

Runtime requirements:
  python39-3.9.10-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  cygport-0.35.3-1
  python39-3.9.10-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack python-empy-3.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./python-empy-3.3.4-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/python-empy-3.3.4-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/python39-empy-3.3.4-X.tar.xz
