Build instructions:
  1. unpack poke-3.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./poke-3.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/poke-3.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/poke-3.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libpoke0-3.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libpoke-devel-3.0-X.tar.xz
