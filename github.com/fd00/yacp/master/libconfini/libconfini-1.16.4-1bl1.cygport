SUMMARY="Yet another INI parser"
DESCRIPTION="The motivation behind this library comes from the observation that many system
applications in GNU/Linux rely on INI-like files (systemd, pacman,
networkmanager, etc.), and for many users who approach GNU/Linux for the first
time it can be frustrating not to have a GUI for configuring their system. So,
I thought, a general .conf/.ini editor for GNOME in dconf-style had to be
done."
