SUMMARY="Authentication service for creating and validating user credentials"
DESCRIPTION="MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating
and validating user credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use
in an HPC cluster environment. It provides a portable API for encoding the
user's identity into a tamper-proof credential that can be obtained by an
untrusted client and forwarded by untrusted intermediaries within a security
realm. Clients within this realm can create and validate credentials without
the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific methods."
