SUMMARY="Tool to find motifs in a set of DNA or protein sequences"
DESCRIPTION="ELPH is a general-purpose Gibbs sampler for finding motifs in a set of DNA or
protein sequences. The program takes as input a set containing anywhere from a
few dozen to thousands of sequences, and searches through them for the most
common motif, assuming that each sequence contains one copy of the motif."
