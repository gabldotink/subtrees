SUMMARY="Library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over arbitrary precision real (mpfr) or complex (mpc) numbers"
DESCRIPTION="mpfrcx is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over
arbitrary precision real (mpfr) or complex (mpc) numbers, without control on
the rounding. The library is in a very preliminary state and has just the few
functions that I need at the moment. On the positive side, it contains
asymptotically fast multiplication routines such as Toomâ€“Cook and the FFT."
