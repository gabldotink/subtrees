SUMMARY="Custom compression for CRAM and others"
DESCRIPTION="This repository implements the custom CRAM codecs used for EXTERNAL block
types. These consist of two variants of the rANS codec (8-bit and 16-bit
renormalisation, with run-length encoding and bit-packing also supported in
the latter), a dynamic arithmetic coder, and custom codecs for name/ID
compression and quality score compression derived from fqzcomp."
