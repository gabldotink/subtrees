libsequence
------------------------------------------
C++ class library for evolutionary genetic analysis

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.1.7-1
  libgcc1-10.2.0-1
  libsequence-devel-1.9.8-1bl1
  libsequence20-1.9.8-1bl1
  libstdc++6-10.2.0-1
  pkg-config-1.6.3-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-11-1
  binutils-2.34+1git.de9c1b7cfe-1
  cygport-0.34.0-1
  gcc-core-10.2.0-1
  gcc-g++-10.2.0-1

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/molpopgen/libsequence/archive/1.9.8.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack libsequence-1.9.8-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libsequence-1.9.8-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libsequence-1.9.8-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libsequence-1.9.8-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libsequence20-1.9.8-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libsequence-devel-1.9.8-X.tar.xz
