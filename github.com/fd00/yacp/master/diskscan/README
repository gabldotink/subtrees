diskscan
------------------------------------------
DiskScan is a Unix/Linux tool to scan a block device and check if there are
unreadable sectors, in addition it uses read latency times as an assessment for
a near failure as sectors that are problematic to read usually entail many
retries. This can be used to assess the state of the disk and maybe decide on a
replacement in advance to its imminent failure. The disk self test may or may
not pick up on such clues depending on the disk vendor decision making logic.
