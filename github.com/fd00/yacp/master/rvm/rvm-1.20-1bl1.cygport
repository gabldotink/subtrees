SUMMARY="C library for unstructured recoverable virtual memory"
DESCRIPTION="RVM, a Recoverable Virtual Memory system, is a mechanism to support persistent
virtual memory in the face of system crashes. The current state of affairs is
that software rather than hardware is limiting factor is systems reliability,
and so RVM is intended to assist in building more robust software. RVMs
principal reliability criterion is to provide permanence of committed changes
and integrity of data over operating system crashes. The fatal nature of these
all-too-frequent events often leaves data structures in a shambles. But the
all-or-none property of atomic transactions can insure consistency of data
structures over crashes and makes the application significantly more robust
with small cost. Using simple, non-nested local transactions, it provides a
way to automatically checkpoint the state of memory before an operation and
restore that state in the event of a crash."
