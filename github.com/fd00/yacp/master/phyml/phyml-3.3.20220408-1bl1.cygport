SUMMARY="Phylogenetic estimation using (Maximum) Likelihood"
DESCRIPTION="PhyML is a software package that uses modern statistical approaches to analyse
alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences in a phylogenetic framework.
The main tool in this package builds phylogenies under the maximum likelihood
criterion. It implements a large number of substitution models coupled to
efficient options to search the space of phylogenetic tree topologies. PhyTime
is another tool in the PhyML package that focuses on divergence date
estimation in a Bayesian setting. The main strengths of PhyTime lies in its
ability to accommodate for uncertrainty in the placement of fossil calibration
and the use of realistic models of rate variation along the tree. Finally,
PhyREX fits the spatial-Lambda-Fleming-Viot model to geo-referenced genetic
data. This model is similar to the structured coalescent but assumes that
individuals are distributed along a spatial continuum rather than discrete
demes. PhyREX can be used to estimate population densities and rates of
dispersal. Its output can be processed by treeannotator (from the BEAST
package) as well as SPREAD."
