SUMMARY="C/C++ Library for Robust, Non-linear Homography Estimation"
DESCRIPTION="A homography (sometimes also called a collineation) is a general plane to
plane projective transformation whose estimation from matched image features
is often necessary in several vision tasks. A homography has eight degrees of
freedom and is represented by a non-singular homogeneous 3x3 matrix. homest
implements a technique for non-linear, robust homography estimation from
matched image point features. This technique computes a homography estimate
that minimizes an appropriate cost function defined on matching points
(currently either non-symmetric transfer error, symmetric transfer error,
Sampson error or reprojection error) and includes robust regression techniques
for coping with outliers."
