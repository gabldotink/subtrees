SUMMARY="Some Useful Fortran Routines"
DESCRIPTION="libSUFR is a library containing Some Useful Fortran Routines that I wrote for
my own use, but that may also be useful for others. At the moment, it also
SUFRs from the fact that Fortran module files are compiler-dependent. The
default installer uses CMake. The code has been used with gfortran (4.4 or
newer), g95 and Intel Fortran and can be used under the conditions of version
3 of the GPL."
