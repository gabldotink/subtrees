SUMMARY="Protocol Buffers implementation in C"
DESCRIPTION="This is protobuf-c, a C implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers data
serialization format. It includes libprotobuf-c, a pure C library that
implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and protoc-c, a code generator that
converts Protocol Buffer .proto files to C descriptor code, based on the
original protoc. protobuf-c formerly included an RPC implementation; that code
has been split out into the protobuf-c-rpc project."
