SUMMARY="Hybrid open proxy monitor fully based on BOPM"
DESCRIPTION="HOPM (Hybrid Open Proxy Monitor) is an open-proxy monitoring bot designed to
monitor an individual server (all servers on the network have to run their own
bot if the IRCD does not support farconnect user mode) with a local
operator {} block and monitor connections. When a client connects to a server,
HOPM will scan the connection for insecure proxies. Insecure proxies are
determined by attempting to connect the proxy back to another host (usually the
IRC server in question)."
