SUMMARY="C++ API to YAZ"
DESCRIPTION="YAZ++ is an application programming interface (API) to YAZ which supports the
development of Z39.50/SRU/Solr client and server applications using C++. Like
YAZ, it supports Z39.50-2003 (version 3) as well as SRU version 1.1 thru 2.0
in both the client and server roles. YAZ++ includes an implementation of the
ZOOM C++ binding and a generic client/server API based on the
Observer/Observable design pattern."
