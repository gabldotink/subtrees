SUMMARY="Pure C++ OAuth library"
DESCRIPTION="liboauthcpp is a pure C++ library for performing OAuth requests. It doesn't
contain any networking code -- you provide for performing HTTP requests
yourself, however you like -- instead focusing on performing OAuth-specific
functionality and providing a nice interface for it. If you already have
infrastructure for making HTTP requests and are looking to add OAuth support,
liboauthcpp is for you."
