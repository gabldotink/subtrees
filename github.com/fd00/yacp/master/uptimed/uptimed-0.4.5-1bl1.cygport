SUMMARY="Uptime record daemon"
DESCRIPTION="Uptimed is an uptime record daemon keeping track of the highest uptimes a
computer system ever had. It uses the system boot time to keep sessions apart
from each other. Uptimed comes with a console front-end to parse the records,
which can also easily be used to show your records on a web page."
