wy60
------------------------------------------
While there are plenty of different terminal emulator programs available, the
majority of them only provide support for VT100 or ANSI style escape codes.
This is not a problem if your applications understand about the TERM
environment variable, but there are many legacy applications which have been
hardcoded with support for the Wyse 60 family of terminals. This is where the
Wy60 Emulator comes into play; it looks at the value of your TERM environment
variable and using the curses library, dynamically converts from Wyse 60 escape
codes to whatever escape sequences your terminal requires. This allows you to
continue using your favorite terminal program while running your old legacy
programs. The code has successfully been tested under Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris,
and Mac OS X -- and will probably run fine under any modern UNIX or POSIX
compliant operating system. While this program is primarily written for UNIX
style environments, it is possible to compile it against the Cygwin libraries
and run it under Windows.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack wy60-2.0.9-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./wy60-2.0.9-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/wy60-2.0.9-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/wy60-2.0.9-X.tar.xz
