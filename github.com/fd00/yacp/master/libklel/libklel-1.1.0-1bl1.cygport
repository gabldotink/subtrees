SUMMARY="KoreLogic Expression Language Library"
DESCRIPTION="The KoreLogic Expression Language Library is a C library that provides a
simple expression language that can be embedded in other programs. This
library does not implement a full programming language, but rather a simpler
expression language called KL-EL that is designed to provide arithmetic and
logic operations useful in situations where embedding a full programming
language would be overkill. KL-EL expressions have access to a full set of
arithmetic and logic operations, and they can access functions and variables
exported from the embedding program. Unlike most other languages of its kind,
KL-EL is statically and strongly typed, which helps ensure that expressions
are valid before they are executed. The embedding API is designed to be easy
to use, and the library itself is designed to be very small."
