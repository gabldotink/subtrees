SUMMARY="Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for short-read alignment"
DESCRIPTION="BWA is a software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large reference
genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms:
BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for
Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences
ranged from 70bp to a few megabases. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features
such as the support of long reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which
is the latest, is generally recommended as it is faster and more accurate.
BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
reads."
