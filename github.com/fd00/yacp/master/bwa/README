bwa
------------------------------------------
BWA is a software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large reference
genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms:
BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina
sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from
70bp to a few megabases. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as the
support of long reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest,
is generally recommended as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has
better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack bwa-0.7.17-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./bwa-0.7.17-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/bwa-0.7.17-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/bwa-0.7.17-X.tar.xz
