CATEGORY="Libs"
SUMMARY="Portable C++ framework for threads and sockets"
DESCRIPTION="GNU uCommon C++ is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate
using C++ design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as
for systems using uclibc along with posix threading support. For this reason,
GNU uCommon C++ disables language features that consume memory or introduce
runtime overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will
mostly be linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than
using the overhead of the standard C++ library and other similar class
frameworks."
