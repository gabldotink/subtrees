SUMMARY="Relational database that is embeddable within applications"
DESCRIPTION="HailDB is a relational database that is embeddable within applications. You
embed HailDB by linking to a shared library and calling a clean and simple
API. HailDB is a continuation of the Embedded InnoDB project. It is not itself
a database server, but is a library implementing the storage layer. With the
addition of the HailDB plugin to Drizzle you get a full SQL interface."
