SUMMARY="Refactorization of the popular Clustal-W 1.8.4 alignment software into a development library"
DESCRIPTION="libClustalW is a refactorization of the popular Clustal-W 1.8.4 alignment
software into a development library. By refactoring Clustal-W into a library,
the various functions implemented in Clustal-W can be called directly by C/C++
programs without forking a separate ClustalW process. In the process of
refactoring, we have attempted to make the fewest possible changes to the
original Clustal W 1.8.4 source code."
