SUMMARY="High-performance C++ multibody dynamics/physics library"
DESCRIPTION="Simbody is a high-performance, open-source toolkit for science- and
engineering-quality simulation of articulated mechanisms, including
biomechanical structures such as human and animal skeletons, mechanical
systems like robots, vehicles, and machines, and anything else that can be
described as a set of rigid bodies interconnected by joints, influenced by
forces and motions, and restricted by constraints. Simbody includes a
multibody dynamics library for modeling motion in generalized/internal
coordinates in O(n) time. This is sometimes called a Featherstone-style
physics engine."
