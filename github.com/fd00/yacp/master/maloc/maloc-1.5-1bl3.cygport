SUMMARY="Minimal Abstraction Layer for Object-oriented C"
DESCRIPTION="MALOC is a small, portable, abstract C environment library for
object-oriented C programming. MALOC is used as the foundation layer
for a number of scientific applications, including MC, SG, and
APBS. MALOC can be used as a small stand-alone abstraction environment
for writing portable C programs which need access to resources which
are typically architecture-dependent, such as INET sockets, timing
routines, and so on. MALOC provides abstract datatypes, memory
management routines, timing routines, machine epsilon, access to UNIX
and INET sockets, MPI, and so on. All things that can vary from one
architecture to another are abstracted out of an application code and
placed in MALOC."
