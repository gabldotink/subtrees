skipfish
------------------------------------------
Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It prepares
an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl
and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then annotated with the
output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks.
The final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for
professional web application security assessments.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-4.4.12-3
  cygwin-3.1.2-1
  libidn11-1.33-1

  libssl1.0-1.0.2t-1
  zlib0-1.2.11-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cygport-0.33.1-1
  gcc-core-7.4.0-1
  make-4.2.1-2

Build instructions:
  1. unpack skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./skipfish-2.10b-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X.tar.xz
