SUMMARY="Implementation of Signaling System 7 (SS7)"
DESCRIPTION="Libss7 is a userspace library that is used for providing SS7 protocol services
to applications.  It has a working MTP2, MTP3, and ISUP for ITU and ANSI style
SS7, however it was written in a manner that will easily allow support for
other various national specific variants in the future. For a working
reference implementation, see the various link test programs, as well as the
Asterisk Open Source PBX."
