SUMMARY="Forked version of log4cpp"
DESCRIPTION="Log4shib is a forked version of log4cpp that has been created for the
Shibboleth project to ensure a consistent, working snapshot that builds
reliably on the necessary platforms. Not every project can afford to devote
resources to every platform, but unfortunately maintaining every other project
just to maintain your own is also not realistic."
