stx-btree
------------------------------------------
The STX B+ Tree package is a set of C++ template classes implementing a B+
tree key/data container in main memory. The classes are designed as drop-in
replacements of the STL containers set, map, multiset and multimap and follow
their interfaces very closely. By packing multiple value pairs into each node
of the tree the B+ tree reduces heap fragmentation and utilizes cache-line
effects better than the standard red-black binary tree. The tree algorithms
are based on the implementation in Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest's Introduction
into Algorithms, Jan Jannink's paper and other algorithm resources. The
classes contain extensive assertion and verification mechanisms to ensure the
implementation's correctness by testing the tree invariants. To illustrate the
B+ tree's structure a wxWidgets demo program is included in the source package.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack stx-btree-0.9-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
         unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./stx-btree-0.9-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/stx-btree-0.9-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/stx-btree-0.9-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/stx-btree-devel-0.9-X.tar.bz2
