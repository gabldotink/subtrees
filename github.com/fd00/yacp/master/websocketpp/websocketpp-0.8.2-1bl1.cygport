SUMMARY="C++/Boost Asio based websocket client/server library"
DESCRIPTION="WebSocket++ is a header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The WebSocket
Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and server functionality into
C++ programs. It uses interchangeable network transport modules including one
based on raw char buffers, one based on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio
(either via Boost or standalone). End users can write additional transport
policies to support other networking or event libraries as needed."
