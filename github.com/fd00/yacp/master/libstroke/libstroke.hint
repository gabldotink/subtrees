sdesc: "Stroke translation library (licensing & readmes)"
ldesc: "LibStroke is a stroke translation library. Strokes are motions of the
mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command. Strokes are used
extensively in CAD programs. I fell in love with them when I was using the CAD
tools that use a stroke interface to select tools or perform actions. I wrote
this library so that others can see how useful strokes can be and so that more
programs take advantage of this extremely natural human-computer interface."
