ldesc: "Sharedance is a high-performance server to centralize ephemeral
key/data pairs on remote hosts, without the overhead and the complexity of
an SQL database.

It was mainly designed to share caches and sessions between a pool of web
servers. Access to a sharedance server is trivial through a simple PHP API and
it is compatible with the expectations of PHP 4 and PHP 5 session handlers."
