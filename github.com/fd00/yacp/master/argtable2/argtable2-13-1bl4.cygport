SUMMARY="ANSI C command line parser"
DESCRIPTION="Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line options with
a minimum of fuss. It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in
the source code as an array of argtable structs. The command line is then
parsed according to that specification and the resulting values are returned
in those same structs where they are accessible to the main program. Both
tagged (-v, --verbose, --foo=bar) and untagged arguments are supported, as are
multiple instances of each argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and
the library also provides the means for generating a textual description of
the command line syntax."
