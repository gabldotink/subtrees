SUMMARY="Extraction of complex frequencies and amplitudes from time series"
DESCRIPTION="Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the problem of
harmonic inversion - given a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists
of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a
given bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes,
and phases of those sinusoids."
