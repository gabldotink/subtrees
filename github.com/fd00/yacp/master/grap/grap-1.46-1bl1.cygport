SUMMARY="Implementation of Kernigan & Bentley's grap language"
DESCRIPTION="Grap is a language for typesetting graphs specified and first implemented by
Brian Kernighan and Jon Bentley at Bell Labs. It is an expressive language for
describing graphs and incorporating them in typeset documents. It is
implemented as a preprocessor to Kernigan's pic language for describing
languages, so any system that can use pic can use grap. For sure, TeX and
groff can use it."
