ldesc: "The libebt library provides a clean way of getting human-readable
backtrace messages in C++. It uses the RAII (resource acquisition is
initialisation) idiom to manage backtrace stack items without needing macros,
control structures or an external debugger -- adding context to a function or
block is done through a single simple variable declaration."
