ecasound
------------------------------------------
Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio processing. It can
be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording and format conversions,
as well as for multitrack effect processing, mixing, recording and signal
recycling. Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect
algorithms. Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and
their parameters can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators and
MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode user-interface is included in the package.
