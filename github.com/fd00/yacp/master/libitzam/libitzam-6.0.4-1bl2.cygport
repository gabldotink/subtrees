SUMMARY="Deliberately Portable Embedded Database Engine"
DESCRIPTION="Itzam/C is a deliberately portable and concise C library for creating and
manipulating keyed-access database files containing variable-length, random
access records. Information is referenced by a user-defined key value; indexes
may be combined with or remain separate from data.

Key features include:

 * 100% ANSI/ISO Standard C promotes portability across platforms.
 * Full 64- and 32-bit support
 * Small footprint, with a sub-150k shared object and sub-50k static library
   on Linux. For Windows, the 32-bit DLL is under 32k, and the 64-bit DLL
   comes in at 39k.
 * File-locking for multiuser/multiprocess/mutilthreaded applications.
 * Transactions with rollback.
 * Indexes using B-tree, hash, and matrix algorithms.
 * No dependancies on any outside libraries. Itzam/C stands by itself.
 * Dual-licensing, both GPL and a license suitable for closed-source projects."
