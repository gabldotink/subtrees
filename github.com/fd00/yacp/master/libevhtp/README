libevhtp
------------------------------------------
Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP API. The
reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created as a JIT server,
meaning the developer never thought of it being used for creating a
full-fledged HTTP service. Infact I am under the impression that the libevent
http API was designed almost as an example of what you can do with libevent.
It's not Apache in a box, but more and more developers are attempting to use it
as so.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.0.7-1
  libevent2.0_5-2.0.22-1
  libevhtp-devel-1.2.18-1bl2
  libevhtp0-1.2.18-1bl2
  libonig5-6.9.1-1
  libssl1.1-1.1.1c-1
  pkg-config-1.6.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cmake-3.14.5-1
  cygport-0.33.1-1
  gcc-core-7.4.0-1
  ninja-1.9.0-1

Build instructions:
  1. unpack libevhtp-1.2.18-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libevhtp-1.2.18-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libevhtp-1.2.18-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp0-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libevhtp-devel-1.2.18-X.tar.xz
