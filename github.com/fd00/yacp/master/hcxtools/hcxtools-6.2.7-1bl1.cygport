SUMMARY="Small set of tools convert packets from captures"
DESCRIPTION="Small set of tools convert packets from captures (h = hash, c = capture,
convert and calculate candidates, x = different hashtypes) for the use with
latest hashcat or John the Ripper. The tools are 100% compatible to hashcat
and John the Ripper and recommended by hashcat. This branch is pretty closely
synced to hashcat git branch (that means: latest hcxtools matching on latest
hashcat beta) and John the Ripper git branch (bleeding-jumbo)."
