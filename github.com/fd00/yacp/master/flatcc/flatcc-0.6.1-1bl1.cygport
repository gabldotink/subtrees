SUMMARY="FlatBuffers Compiler and Library in C for C"
DESCRIPTION="flatcc has no external dependencies except for build and compiler tools, and
the C runtime library. With concurrent Ninja builds, a small client project
can build flatcc with libraries, generate schema code, link the project and
execute a test case in a few seconds, produce binaries between 15K and 60K,
read small buffers in 30ns, build FlatBuffers in about 600ns, and with a
larger executable also handle optional json parsing or printing in less than 2
us for a 10 field mixed type message."
