SUMMARY="Property-based testing for C"
DESCRIPTION="theft is a C library for property-based testing. Rather than checking the
results with specific input, properties are asserted (for any possible input,
[condition] should hold), and theft searches for counter-examples. If it finds
a combination of arguments that causes the property to fail, it will search
for simpler versions of those arguments that still fail, and then print the
minimal failing input."
