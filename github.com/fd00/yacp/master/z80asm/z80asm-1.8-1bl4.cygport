SUMMARY="Z80 Assembler"
DESCRIPTION="z80asm is an assembler for the Z80 microprocessor. The assembler aims to be
portable and complete. Of course it assembles all official mnemonics, but it
also aims to assemble the unofficial mnemonics. The assembler was written with
the MSX computer in mind as the target platform, but it can be used for any
system with a Z80 in it. Some header files with labels of MSX specific
addresses (BIOS, BDOS, system variables) are included."
