CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="Fastest feature-rich C++11/14/17/20 single-header testing framework"
DESCRIPTION="doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest both in
compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime compared to other
feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled languages such as
D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to
a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface."
