SUMMARY="Unsupervised text tokenizer for Neural Network-based text generation"
DESCRIPTION="SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for
Neural Network-based text generation systems where the vocabulary size is
predetermined prior to the neural model training. SentencePiece implements
subword units (e.g., byte-pair-encoding (BPE) [Sennrich et al.]) and unigram
language model [Kudo.]) with the extension of direct training from raw 
entences. SentencePiece allows us to make a purely end-to-end system that does
not depend on language-specific pre/postprocessing."
