SUMMARY="Random C program generator"
DESCRIPTION="Csmith is a tool that can generate random C programs that statically and
dynamically conform to the C99 standard. It is useful for stress-testing
compilers, static analyzers, and other tools that process C code. Csmith has
found bugs in every tool that it has tested, and we have used it to find and
report more than 400 previously-unknown compiler bugs."
