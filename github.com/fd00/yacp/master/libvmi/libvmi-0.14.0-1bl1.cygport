SUMMARY="Simplified Virtual Machine Introspection"
DESCRIPTION="LibVMI is a virtual machine introspection library. This means that it helps
you access the memory of a running virtual machine. LibVMI provides primitives
for accessing this memory using physical or virtual addresses and kernel
symbols. LibVMI also supports accessing memory from a physical memory
snapshot, which is helpful for debugging or forensic analysis."
