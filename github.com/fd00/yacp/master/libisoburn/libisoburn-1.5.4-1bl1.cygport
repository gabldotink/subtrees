SUMMARY="Frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs"
DESCRIPTION="Libisoburn is a front-end for libraries libburn and libisofs which enables
creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/DVD/BD media
supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW, which do not support
multi-session management on media level and even plain disk files or block
devices. Price for that is thorough specialization on data files in ISO-9660
filesystem images. And so libisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or any
other CD layout which does not entirely consist of ISO-9660 sessions."
