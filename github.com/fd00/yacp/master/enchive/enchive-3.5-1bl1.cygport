SUMMARY="Encrypted personal archives"
DESCRIPTION="Enchive is a tool to encrypt files to yourself for long-term archival. It's a
focused, simple alternative to more complex solutions such as GnuPG or
encrypted filesystems. Enchive has no external dependencies and is trivial to
build for local use. Portability is emphasized over performance."
