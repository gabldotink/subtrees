ldesc: "This library in this distribution implements Just-In-Time compilation
functionality.  Unlike other JIT's, this one is designed to be independent
of any particular virtual machine bytecode format or language.  The hope
is that Free Software projects can get a leg-up on proprietry VM vendors
by using this library rather than spending large amounts of time writing
their own JIT from scratch."
