SUMMARY="Anfo Short Read Aligner/Mapper"
DESCRIPTION="Anfo is a mapper in the spirit of Soap/Maq/Bowtie, but its implementation
takes more after BLAST/BLAT. It's most useful for the alignment of sequencing
reads where the DNA sequence is somehow modified (think ancient DNA or
bisulphite treatment) and/or there is more divergence between sample and
reference than what fast mappers will handle gracefully (say the reference
genome is missing and a related species is used instead)."
