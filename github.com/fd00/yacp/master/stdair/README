stdair
------------------------------------------
StdAir aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++ implementation,
for the basis of Airline IT and travel distribution Business Object Model
(BOM), that is, to be used by several other open source projects, including all
the components of the Travel Market Simulator
(http://www.travel-market-simulator.com), such as AirRAC, RMOL, AirInv, AvlCal,
AirTSP, SimFQT, SimLFS, SimCRS, TravelCCM, SEvMgr, TraDemGen, and TvlSim.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack stdair-1.00.12-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./stdair-1.00.12-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/stdair-1.00.12-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/stdair-1.00.12-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libstdair1.00-1.00.12-X.tar.xz
