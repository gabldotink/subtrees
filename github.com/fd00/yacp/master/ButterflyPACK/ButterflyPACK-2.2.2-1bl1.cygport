SUMMARY="Mathematical software for rapidly solving large-scale dense linear systems"
DESCRIPTION="ButterflyPACK is a mathematical software for rapidly solving large-scale dense
linear systems that exhibit off-diagonal rank-deficiency. These systems arise
frequently from boundary element methods, or factorization phases in
finite-difference/finite-element methods. ButterflyPACK relies on low-rank or
butterfly formats under Hierarchical matrix, HODLR or other hierarchically
nested frameworks to compress, factor and solve the linear system in
quasi-linear time. The computationally most intensive phase, factorization, is
accelerated via randomized linear algebras. The butterfly format, originally
inspired by the butterfly data flow in fast Fourier Transform, is a linear
algebra tool well-suited for compressing matrices arising from high-frequency
wave equations or highly oscillatory integral operators. ButterflyPACK also
provides preconditioned TFQMR iterative solvers."
