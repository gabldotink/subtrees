rg_etc1
------------------------------------------
rg_etc1.cpp is a ZLIB licensed, performant, easy to use, and high quality 4x4
pixel block packer/unpacker for the ETC1 (Ericsson Texture Compression) texture
compression format written in a single C++ source file. It has no external
compile-time or run-time dependencies on any other library or API, allowing it
to be trivially dropped in to other projects.

rg_etc1 is 2-28x faster than Ericsson's example ETC1 texture compressor used in
the etc-pack tool, and is comparable in quality (RGB MSE). (As of this writing
[5/13/12], and as far as I can determine, rg_etc1.cpp/h is the fastest, and
only known open source alternative to Ericsson's example compressor.)

The ETC/ETC1 texture compression format is supported by OpenGL ES and is
implemented in the GPU's used on many Android phones/tablets.

Build instructions:
  unpack rg_etc1-1.04-X-src.tar.xz
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./rg_etc1-1.04-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/rg_etc1-1.04-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/rg_etc1-1.04-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/librg_etc1_0-1.04-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/librg_etc1-devel-1.04-X.tar.xz
