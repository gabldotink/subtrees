SUMMARY="Adaptive large scale remote executions deployment"
DESCRIPTION="TakTuk is a tool for deploying parallel remote executions of commands to a
potentially large set of remote nodes. It spreads itself using an adaptive
algorithm and sets up an interconnection network to transport commands and
perform I/Os multiplexing/demultiplexing. The TakTuk mechanics dynamically
adapt to environment (machine performance and current load, network
contention) by using a reactive work-stealing algorithm that mixes local
parallelization and work distribution."
