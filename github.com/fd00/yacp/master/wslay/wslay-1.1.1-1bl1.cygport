SUMMARY="WebSocket library in C"
DESCRIPTION="Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C. It implements the protocol version
13 described in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API: event-based API
and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it is suitable for
non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set callbacks in various events.
For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only
supports data transfer part of WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening
handshake in HTTP."
