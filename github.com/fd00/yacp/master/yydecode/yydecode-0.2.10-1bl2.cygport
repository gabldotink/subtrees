SUMMARY="Decode yEnc archives"
DESCRIPTION="yydecode is a highly portable decoder for yEnc encoded binaries, which
unfortunately has recently been spreading like wildfire on Usenet. The name
yydecode is a play on the infamous uudecode program, although that's not the
only similarity â€“ yydecode aims to behave like uudecode; in normal
circumstances it can be used as a direct drop-in replacement."
