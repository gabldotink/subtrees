oatpp
------------------------------------------
Oat++ is a modern Web Framework for C++. It's fully loaded and contains all
necessary components for effective production level development. It's also
light and has a small memory footprint.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.2.0-1
  libgcc1-11.2.0-1
  liboatpp1-1.2.5-1bl1
  libstdc++6-11.2.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.37-2
  cmake-3.20.0-1
  cygport-0.34.0-1
  gcc-core-11.2.0-1
  gcc-g++-11.2.0-1
  ninja-1.10.2-1

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp/archive/refs/tags/1.2.5.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack oatpp-1.2.5-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./oatpp-1.2.5-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/oatpp-1.2.5-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/oatpp-1.2.5-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/liboatpp1-1.2.5-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/liboatpp-devel-1.2.5-X.tar.xz
