SUMMARY="Travel Market Simulator"
DESCRIPTION="The Travel Market Simulator project aims at providing reference
implementation, mainly in C++, of a travel market simulator, focusing on
revenue management (RM) for airlines. It is intended to be used for applied
research activities only: it is by no way intended to be used by production
systems. It is a new breed of software and aims to become the new generation
PODS (http://podsresearch.com/), which was instrumental in the inception of
the Travel Market Simulator project."
