SUMMARY="C++ binding for the OpenGL API, generated using the gl.xml specification"
DESCRIPTION="glbinding leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and
variadic templates, instead of relying on macros; all OpenGL symbols are real
functions and variables. It provides type-safe parameters, per feature API
header, lazy function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support,
global and local function callbacks, meta information about the generated
OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as tools and examples for
quick-starting your projects. Based on the OpenGL API specification (gl.xml)
glbinding is generated using python scripts and templates that can be easily
adapted to fit custom needs."
