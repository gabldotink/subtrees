ldesc: "sitecopy allows you to easily maintain remote Web sites. The program
will upload files to the server which have changed locally, and delete files
from the server which have been removed locally, to keep the remote site
synchronized with the local site, with a single command. sitecopy will also
optionally try to spot files you move locally, and move them remotely. FTP and
WebDAV servers are supported."
