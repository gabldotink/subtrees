SUMMARY="C++/Fortran-90 arbitrary precision package"
DESCRIPTION="ARPREC is a software package for performing arbitrary precision arithmetic. It
consists of a revision and extension of Bailey's earlier MPFUN package,
enhanced with special IEEE numerical techniques. Features include:

 * Written in C++ for broad portability and fast execution.

 * Includes C++ and Fortran 90/95 interfaces based on custom data-types and
   operator/function overloading, which permit the library to be used with
   only minor modifications for many conventional C++ and Fortran-90 programs.

 * Includes all of the usual arithmetic operations, as well as many
   transcendental functions, including cos, sin, tan, arccos, arcsin, arctan,
   exp, log, log10, erf, gamma and Bessel functions.

 * Supports three arbitrary precision data-types: mp_real, mp_int and
   mp_complex.

 * Supports many mixed-mode operations between arbitrary precision variables
   or constants and conventional variables or constants.

 * Includes special library routines, incorporating advanced algorithms for
   extra-high precision (above 1000 digits) computation.

 * Includes a number of sample application programs, including programs for
   quadrature (numerical definite integrals), PLSQ (integer relation finding)
   and polynomial root finding.

 * Includes the Experimental Mathematician's Toolkit. This is a self-contained
   interactive program that performs many operations typical of modern
   experimental mathematics, including arithmetic expressions, common
   transcendental functions, infinite series evaluation, definite integrals,
   polynomial roots, user-defined functions, all evaluated to a user-defined
   level of numeric precision, up to 1000 decimal digits."
