ChinaDNS
------------------------------------------
Traditional way to bypass DNS poisoning is to send all queries to a foreign
DNS server via VPN. However some Chinese websites will get bad results if they
have CDNs outside the country.

The second way is to maintain a list of domains of which you want to resolve
from local DNS or foreign DNS. This list changes too often, taking too much
effort to maintain.

ChinaDNS automatically queries local DNS servers to resolve Chinese domains
and queries foreign DNS servers to resolve foreign domains. It is smart enough
to work only with a Chinese IP range file, which doesn't change often.

In order to bypass IP blocking, you SHOULD use VPN software like ShadowVPN.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack ChinaDNS-1.3.2-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./ChinaDNS-1.3.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ChinaDNS-1.3.2-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/ChinaDNS-1.3.2-X.tar.xz
