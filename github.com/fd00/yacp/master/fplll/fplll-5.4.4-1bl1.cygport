SUMMARY="Lattice algorithms using floating-point arithmetic"
DESCRIPTION="fplll contains several algorithms on lattices that rely on floating-point
computations. This includes implementations of the floating-point LLL
reduction algorithm, offering different speed/guarantees ratios. It contains a
wrapper choosing the estimated best sequence of variants in order to provide a
guaranteed output as fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the
succession of variants is oblivious to the user. It also includes a rigorous
floating-point implementation of the Kannan-Fincke-Pohst algorithm that finds
a shortest non-zero lattice vector."
