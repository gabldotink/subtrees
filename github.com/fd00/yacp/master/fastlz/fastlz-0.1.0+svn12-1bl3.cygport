SUMMARY="Free, open-source, portable real-time compression library"
DESCRIPTION="FastLZ is a lossless data compression library designed for real-time
compression and decompression. It favors speed over compression ratio.
Decompression requires no memory. Decompression algorithm is very simple, and
thus extremely fast.

Due to its speed, FastLZ is very useful for applications that need to save
some space without a sacrifice in performance. In certain cases, using
compressed working data blocks (and decompressing them on-the-fly whenever
necessary) actually may improve the performance because the program uses less
memory space.

FastLZ is implemented in portable C. It should compile on different platforms
without problem.

FastLZ is very small and self-contained. To use it, just add one header file
and one source file to the application project. Since it is distributed using
MIT license, FastLZ can be used in open-source GPL/LGPL-ed applications as
well as proprietary applications.

FastLZ is inspired by Herman Vogt's LZV and Marc Lehmann's LZF algorithms."
