ldesc: "For some projects of mine, I wanted a lightweight C library that can
parse John Gruber's [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
format into whatever I want, and that is easily extendable.

The only C implementations of markdown that I know of are [Discount]
(http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/markdown/) and [PEG-markdown]
(http://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown/tree/master). Discount seemed a little
bit too integrated and focused on HTML output for my taste, and
PEG-markdown seemed to have a lot of dependencies and stuff. So I wrote my
own.

I like to keep things simple, so I wrote a function that performs *only*
markdown parsing: no file reading or writing, no (X)HTML considerations,
etc. The actual output is performed by a set of dedicated callback
functions, called here a renderer. Some example renderers are provided, but
you are free to use your own to output in any format you like.

This callback mechanism make libupskirt so flexible that it does not need
any flag or external information besides input text and renderer to
operate."
