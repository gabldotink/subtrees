SUMMARY="Medium-level constraint modelling language"
DESCRIPTION="MiniZinc is a medium-level constraint modelling language. It is high-level
enough to express most constraint problems easily, but low-level enough that
it can be mapped onto existing solvers easily and consistently. It is a subset
of the higher-level language Zinc. We hope it will be adopted as a standard by
the Constraint Programming community."
