ldesc: "Nazghul is a computer role-playing game (CRPG) engine. Here's what it
looks like when played. Obviously, the emphasis is not on graphics or
first-person squad-based stealth action. If you like roguelikes or the
top-down, 2d, turn-based CRPG's that disappeared in the early 90's then this
is for you."
