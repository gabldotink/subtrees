SUMMARY="Distributed compiler with a central scheduler to share build load"
DESCRIPTION="Icecream was created by SUSE based on distcc. Like distcc, Icecream takes
compile jobs from a build and distributes it among remote machines allowing a
parallel build. But unlike distcc, Icecream uses a central server that
dynamically schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server. This
advantage pays off mostly for shared computers, if you're the only user on x
machines, you have full control over them."
