SUMMARY="C++ implementation of the classic 3-layer perceptron in library form"
DESCRIPTION="libneural is an extremely tiny library for creating a software 3-layer
backpropagation neural network. This is useful for a very wide variety of
pattern recognition and classification problems. It is written in C++, based
on the standard algorithm with NO fancy features like bias terms or momentum."
