gibson
------------------------------------------
Gibson is a high efficiency, tree based memory cache server. Normal key-value
stores ( memcache, Redis, etc ) uses a hash table as their main data
structure, so every key is hashed with a specific algorithm and the resulting
hash is used to identify the given value in memory. This approach, although
very fast, doesn't allow the user to execute globbing expressions/selections
on a given (multiple) keyset, thus resulting on a pure one-by-one access
paradigm. Gibson is different, it uses a special tree based structure allowing
the user to perform operations on multiple key sets using a prefix expression
achieving the same performance grades in the worst case, even better on an
average case. Unlike many other server applications, it's not multithreaded,
but it uses multiplexing taking advantace of an event-driven network layer
( just like Node.js, or Nginx using libevent and so on ) which provides higher
performances even on low cost hardware.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack gibson-1.2.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./gibson-1.2.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/gibson-1.2.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/gibson-1.2.1-X.tar.xz
