SUMMARY="Fast C library for evaluating poker hands"
DESCRIPTION="poker-eval is a C library to evaluate poker hands. The result of the evalution
for a given hand is a number. The general idea is that if the evalution of
your hand is lower than the evaluation of the hand of your opponent, you lose.
Many poker variants are supported (draw, holdem, omaha, etc.) and more can be
added. poker-eval is designed for speed so that it can be used within poker
simulation software using either exhaustive exploration or Monte Carlo."
