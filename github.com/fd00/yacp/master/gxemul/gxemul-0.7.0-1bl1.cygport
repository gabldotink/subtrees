SUMMARY="Gavare's eXperimental Emulator"
DESCRIPTION="GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation.
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented.
It is working well enough to allow unmodified guest operating systems to
run inside the emulator, as if they were running on real hardware."
