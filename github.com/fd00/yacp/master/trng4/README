trng4
------------------------------------------
Tina's Random Number Generator Library (TRNG) is a state of the art C++
pseudo-random number generator library for sequential and parallel Monte Carlo
simulations. Its design principles are based on a proposal for an extensible
random number generator facility, that has become part of the C++11 standard.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.1.7-1
  libtrng4-devel-4.23-1bl1
  libtrng4_23-4.23-1bl1
  pkg-config-1.6.3-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.34+1git.de9c1b7cfe-1
  cmake-3.17.3-2
  cygport-0.34.0-1
  gcc-core-10.2.0-1
  gcc-g++-10.2.0-1
  ninja-1.10.1-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack trng4-4.23-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./trng4-4.23-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/trng4-4.23-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/trng4-4.23-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libtrng4_23-4.23-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libtrng4-devel-4.23-X.tar.xz
