SUMMARY="Memory-based tagger"
DESCRIPTION="MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator
part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged
sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be
used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language
processing. It has also been used for named-entity recognition, information
extraction in domain-specific texts, and disfluency chunking in transcribed
speech."
