libtess2
------------------------------------------
This is refactored version of the original libtess which comes with the GLU
reference implementation. The code is good quality polygon tesselator and
triangulator. The original code comes with rather horrible interface and its'
performance suffers from lots of small memory allocations. The main point of
the refactoring has been the interface and memory allocation scheme.

Simple bucketed memory allocator (see Graphics Gems III for reference) was
added which speeds up the code by order of magnitude (tests showed 15 to 50
times improvement depending on data). The API allows the user to pass his own
allocator to the library. It is possible to configure the library so that the
library runs on predefined chunk of memory.

The API was changed to loosely resemble the OpenGL vertex array API. The
processed data can be accessed via getter functions. The code is able to
output contours, polygons and connected polygons. The output of the tesselator
can be also used as input for new run. I.e. the user may first want to
calculate an union all the input contours and the triangulate them.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack libtess2-1.0.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libtess2-1.0.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libtess2-1.0.1-X-src.tar.xz
