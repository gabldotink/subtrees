SUMMARY="Z39.50 proxy and router utilizing Yaz toolkit"
DESCRIPTION="Metaproxy is a proxy front end server that presents a single Z39.50/SRW/SRU
front end to multiple back end database servers. It can also work in
conjunction with Index Dataâ€™s library of gateways to access non-standard
database servers. We like to call it a metasearch server in-a-box. It is
important to note, however, that Metaproxy is server software and does not
have a user interface. It is designed to easily tie into any existing
standards-based interface."
