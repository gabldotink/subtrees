qpid-proton
------------------------------------------
Qpid Proton is a high-performance, lightweight messaging library. It can be
used in the widest range of messaging applications, including brokers, client
libraries, routers, bridges, proxies, and more. Proton makes it trivial to
integrate with the AMQP 1.0 ecosystem from any platform, environment, or
language.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack qpid-proton-0.37.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./qpid-proton-0.37.0-X.cygport all
