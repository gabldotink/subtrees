SUMMARY="Secret sharing library"
DESCRIPTION="In simple terms, this package provides a library for implementing the sharing
of secrets and two tools for simple use-cases of the algorithm. The library
implements what is known as Shamir's method for secret sharing in the Galois
Field 2^8. In slightly simpler words, this is N-of-M secret-sharing
byte-by-byte. Essentially this allows us to split a secret S into any M shares
S1...SM such that any N of those shares can be used to reconstruct S but any
less than N shares yields no information whatsoever."
