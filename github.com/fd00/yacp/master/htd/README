htd
------------------------------------------
htd is a library which does not only compute tree decompositions, it also
allows to fully customize them via (custom) manipulations, labelings and
optimize them based on a user-provided fitness function. The library provides
efficient implementations of well-established techniques for computing tree
decompositions (like bucket-elimination based on a vertex elimination ordering
of the input graph) and it is optimized for large (hyper)graphs. At the current
stage, htd is able to decompose graphs containing millions of vertices and
several hundreds of thousands of (hyper)edges efficiently.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack htd-1.2-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./htd-1.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/htd-1.2-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/htd-1.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libhtd0-1.2-X.tar.xz
