archdiff
------------------------------------------
Archive Diff is a convient command-line utility which allows humans to browse
the line-by-line differences between the files in two source code archives. It
is written in the C programming language and is made available under the GPLv3
license. This program is dedicated to those paranoid souls who prefer to
install system software from source code and also like to know for themselves
precisely what has been changed between two versions.

Many people are satisfied with a simple examination of the ChangeLog to know
what has been changed in a software release. But can you really know for sure,
unless you see each line of source code that has removed or added? Archive
Diff allows you to do this without going to the trouble of unwrapping the
archives yourself and running the correct diff commands.

Archive Diff should be able to handle any archive formats and compression
formats which can be handled by your implementation of libarchive. (E.g.,
tar.gz, tar.xz, zip.)

Please note that this utility is designed for the convenience of HUMAN
browsing. It should not be used to create patch files or anything else which
requires a machine-level exactness.
