SUMMARY="Robust and fast clustering method for amplicons"
DESCRIPTION="The purpose of swarm is to provide a novel clustering algorithm that handles
massive sets of amplicons. Results of traditional clustering algorithms are
strongly input-order dependent, and rely on an arbitrary global clustering
threshold. swarm results are resilient to input-order changes and rely on a
small local linking threshold d, representing the maximum number of
differences between two amplicons. swarm forms stable, high-resolution
clusters, with a high yield of biological information."
