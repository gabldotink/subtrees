SUMMARY="Library and command line tool to detect SHA-1 collision in a file"
DESCRIPTION="This library and command line tool were designed as near drop-in replacements
for common SHA-1 libraries and sha1sum. They will compute the SHA-1 hash of
any given file and additionally will detect cryptanalytic collision attacks
against SHA-1 present in each file. It is very fast and takes less than twice
the amount of time as regular SHA-1."
