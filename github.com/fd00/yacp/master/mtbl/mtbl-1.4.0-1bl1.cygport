SUMMARY="Immutable sorted string table library"
DESCRIPTION="mtbl is a C library implementation of the Sorted String Table (SSTable) data
structure, based on the SSTable implementation in the open source Google
LevelDB library. An SSTable is a file containing an immutable mapping of keys
to values. Keys are stored in sorted order, with an index at the end of the
file allowing keys to be located quickly."
