kallisto
------------------------------------------
kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq
data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing
reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly determining
the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for alignment. On
benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto can quantify 30 million human
bulk RNA-seq reads in less than 3 minutes on a Mac desktop computer using only
the read sequences and a transcriptome index that itself takes than 10 minutes
to build. Pseudoalignment of reads preserves the key information needed for
quantification, and kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also comparably
accurate to other existing quantification tools. In fact, because the
pseudoalignment procedure is robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks
kallisto significantly outperforms existing tools.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack kallisto-0.48.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./kallisto-0.48.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/kallisto-0.48.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/kallisto-0.48.0-X.tar.xz
