SUMMARY="Preprocessor for double dispatch in C++"
DESCRIPTION="Doublecpp is a preprocessor for C++ that handles a new linguistic construct for
defining branches of a multi-method. The right branch of such a method will
be selected dynamically at run-time according to the actual type of the object
on which the method is invoked and to the actual type of the first argument:
double dispatch."
