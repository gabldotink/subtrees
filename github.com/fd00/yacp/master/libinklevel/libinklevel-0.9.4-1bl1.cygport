SUMMARY="Library to get the ink level of your printer"
DESCRIPTION="Libinklevel is a library for checking the ink level of your printer on a
system which runs Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris. It supports printers attached via
parallel port or USB. Currently printers of the following brands are
supported: HP, Epson and Canon. Canon BJNP network printers are supported
too. A detailed list of supported printers can be found here. This is not
official software from the printer manufacturers. The goal of this project is
to create a vendor independent API for retrieving the ink level of a printer
connected to a Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris box. You can download the current
version from here."
