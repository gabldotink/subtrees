SUMMARY="Lightweight library for GTK+ programs using C++ in POSIX environments"
DESCRIPTION="c++-gtk-utils is a lightweight library containing a number of classes and
functions for programming GTK+ programs using C++ in POSIX (unix-like)
environments, where the user does not want to use a full-on wrapper such as
gtkmm or wxWidgets, or is concerned about exception safety or thread safety of
the wrapper and their documentation. It is parallel installable for both GTK+2
and GTK+3. There is also an option to install a subset of the library with
only glib/gobject/gio support, without GTK+."
