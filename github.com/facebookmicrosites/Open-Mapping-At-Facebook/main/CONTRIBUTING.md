# Contributing to "Open Mapping At Facebook"
We want to make contributing to this repository as easy and transparent as possible.


## Our Development Process
As a documentation repo, documents in different folders are be updated when their corresponding projects are updated.

For example, if we start a new mapping project on OpenStreetMap (OSM), we will add a link to that project in the [General Info section of README.md](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/blob/master/README.md#general-info). Or if have developed new features on Map With AI, we will update the [training materials](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/wiki) correspondingly to include instructions about how to use them.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and suggestions on the documents in this repo. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions for us to locate the problem. We will follow up on issues to evaluate whether the problems/suggestions described there are generally applicable and valuable to the audience of this repo. If yes, we will update the documentation accordingly.
