Goal: Consolidate data concerning the evolution of a Unix system
in a form that helps the study of the system's evolution,
by entering them into a revision repository.

Research-Development-*
	Contains the files from the releases committed at their
	last modification date.
	This is merged after each release on the date of the newest file
	in a specific release.
Research-Release
	Contains a complete snapshot of each release by merging complete
	development and (possibly) SCCS branches.
	Tagged with the name of the release

BSD-Development
	The parent is Research-Release v7
	As above
BSD-SCCS
	A recursive import of the SCCS repos
	According to https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd/blob/master/README
	"The project began using a source code control system (SCCS) in 1980 
	three years after Bill Joy began his initial Berkeley UNIX
	development)."
	Given that 3BSD was released at the end of 1979, it seems logical to
	import SCCS commits on top of BSD3
	(Files in BSD 4.0 start on Oct 1 1980)
	The SCCS logs are available on CD-ROM from:
	https://www.mckusick.com/csrg/

Unix32V
	http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/VAX/Distributions/32V/
	Parent is the Seventh Edition

BSD-Release
	As above
	In addition each release's commit is marked as a merge with the
	SCCS branch at the timepoint of its creation.

Early FreeBSD git {{{1
The FreeBSD-1.1.5.1 distribution is strange
It contains a CVS repo, a new.tar.gz file, and a tarballs/srcdist directory
The Makefile documents how the git repo is created

Extracting FreeBSD-1.1.5.1/tarballs/srcdist with
cd FreeBSD-1.1.5.1/tarballs/srcdist
mkdir ../../../tarballs
EXTRACT_TARGET=../../../tarballs ./EXTRACT.sh
yields a source directory that appears to be the same as the
checkout of FreeBSD-release/1.1.5 from CVS (git) appart from the
RCS Id headers.

The following command sequences show that the main differences are RCS Id tags
cd archive/freebsd-early.git
git checkout FreeBSD-release/1.0
diff -r . ../FreeBSD-1.0/filesys/usr/src/

cd archive/freebsd-early.git
git checkout FreeBSD-release/1.1
diff -r . ../FreeBSD-1.1/filesys/usr/src/

The git FreeBSD-release/1.0.2 tag only contains the sys directory
It is therefore removed from the git tags.

The file new/RELNOTES.FreeBSD from new.tar.gz claims to be from FreeBSD 1.1,
but many files appear to be newer than 1.1.  They are also older from 1.1.5.
Therefore, the file new.tar.gz is ignored, because it seems to represent
changes include in the CVS repo.

Lessons learned {{{1
Split responsibilities between kernel and device drivers
Ability to follow file moves by keeping a lookaside copy of preceding snapshot
Ownership: early man pages, then BSD man pages
Which commands are retained? Has it got to do with the author's presence?
Significant code duplication in early releases
Co-distributed systems: Lisp, Pascal, Ingres, Ratfor
Performance problems: git takes tens of seconds to show a commit, minutes to blame
CVS repo covering FreeBSD 1.*



New strategy {{{1
First commit:
rename old top directories to previous_version/...

Last commit
Remove previous_version
TODO {{{1
- Add https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate.git which is a Unix System V
  descendant. The commits cover the period from Jun 2005 until today.
- Compare snapshots with corresponding SCCS to see when coverage is sufficient
- Add
 - 4.* merging appropriate SCCS time points. According to CSRG/cd4/README
   "The project began using a source code control system (SCCS)
   in 1980 (three years after Bill Joy began his initial Berkeley UNIX
   development).  Initially only the kernel was put under SCCS, but
   by 1983 everything had been put under SCCS."

  Therefore until 1983 (4.1c?) releases are imported incrementally.
  into -Development-
  When importing skip over
   - SCCS and .MAP files
  At the release add the SCCS files to the release image
  From then on BSD-SCCS is merged directly (in one go) into -Release- at the
  timestamp of each release, and a tag is created

- Flag to indicate release text file
- Coalesce commits by the same author on same date/time and with same
  message (for SCCS) in import-dir.pl
  E.g.
  Author: Bill Joy <bill@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU>
  Date:   Mon Apr 14 16:58:04 1980 -0800
      IUPDAT fast inline from inline.h in stat()

- Indicate in unmatched % changed and remove unchanged files
  (could be done with git blame on each file)
- Add support for SCCS file comment fields (^AT and ^At)
  See http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.aix.files%2Fdoc%2Faixfiles%2Fsccsfile.htm
- On FreeBSD import add a from to the reference files to commits missing a from field
- Check for duplicate files at existing tags and add them to the ignore lists
- Add actual persons in the BSD-default file.  For instance 4.2 appears to have been released by Sam Leffler, and later versions by Keith Bostic
- Use more descriptive characters in names (./).  It seems that are almost
alwaysallowed.  See https://wincent.com/wiki/Legal_Git_branch_names
- Attribute BSD code based on http://netbsd.org/people/CSRG-contrib.html
- Add NetBSD 0.8 based on http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/share/misc/bsd-family-tree and https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/share/misc/bsd-family-tree?view=co
git log --all --pretty=format:'%ae' | sed 's/@.*//' | sort -u >../freebsd.authors
- Merge 4.4BSD Lite 2 into FreeBSD 3.0
- Use the 4th Edition manual page authors to claim ownership of source files
in later editions.
- Jeremy C. Reed writes: By the way, there are scattered SCCS files or SCCS history found in the tarballs in the CSRG set that are not included in the csrg-sccs repo.  For example look for the SCCS files in 4.1c.1.  I didn't look recently, but I recall some of that code there was different.
- Incorporate people from https://www.netbsd.org/people/CSRG-contrib.html into authorship information.
- Add the Second Edition source code http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/1972_stuff/Readme
Based on the path names in s2-bits and the Fifth Edition directory layout the the files should be placed in usr/source/s1
- Visualize the repo with https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource (suggested by C.Meloche)
- Add 386BSD patchkit
- Add PDP7 Unix: https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix/tree/master/scans
- Use single author in commit messages (this will improve GitHub attribution).  Additional authors can be added in the comment.
- Perform seamless merges (without reference files) when the next import is Git based and includes all files. For example, import freebsd-early.git from ec7d9c94e5bf, which contains all files from 386BSD + patchkit
