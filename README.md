# Starling Bank Technical Challenge

We’d like you to develop a “round-up” feature for Starling customers using our public developer API that is available to all customers and partners.

For a customer, take all the transactions in a given week and round them up to the nearest pound.
For example with spending of £4.35, £5.20 and £0.87, the round-up would be £1.58.
This amount should then be transferred into a savings goal, helping the customer save for future adventures.

## Usage

### Usage - Logging
The log level defaults to `info`, but you can set level via the command line argument `--log-level` or the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` can be used to set the logging level. If both are set the command line value takes precedence.

## Technical Decisions
### Language Choice
I choose to use Go for several reasons.
The first is because it is a simple language, making projects very maintainable.
Go has excellent support for HTTP and JSON in the standard library.
Go is statically typed, helping to catch bugs when the stakes are high, like when working with money.
Go also has excellent performance charismatics.

## Possible Improvement
### Support Multiple Accounts
To make it simpler currently only a singular account is supported.
If multiple are returned by the Starling API, then it only actions upon the first account.
You could support multiple accounts by having `GetAccountUid()` in `api/accounts/accounts.go` return an array of UIDs.

### Snapshot Testing
This project has unit tests asserting that valid JSON responses from Starling's API can be successfully parsed.
The unit tests only assert that the parsing did not error and on the number of objects returned.
Constructing and asserting upon the expected array of objects would produce low-value and fragile tests, as the tests are asserting upon the structure of internal data models, not on behaviour.
Snapshot testing could be added, which takes a snapshot of your output and compares it against the snapshot committed alongside your test.
Snapshot testing would have the benefits of adding more assertions on the structure of internal data models and reducing fragility while making the tests easier to update, as you do not have to cumbersomely construct the expected array of objects.

## Development
[🌍 Earthly](https://earthly.dev) is used as the build tool, it is a CI/CD framework that allows you to develop pipelines locally and run them anywhere.
Earthly leverages containers for the execution of pipelines.
This makes them self-contained, repeatable, portable and parallel.

### Setup
You only need Earthly and Docker installed, Earthly handles all build and runtime dependencies.

* [Get Earthly](https://earthly.dev/get-earthly)
