# HRX.js
An implementation of the HRX standard in JavaScript for NodeJS using MemFS. Allows you to build entire applications neatly into one file then execute from there.

## Compatibility Notes
This uses negative lookbehinds in regular expressions so you have to use a relatively recent version of node.
