## Background

This program was part of our project at [HackNC 2014](http://hacknc.us/),
the boxwich. It won 3rd place overall as well as the sponsor's choice awards from
[Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) and
[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

We wanted to make something that solved a serious problem: deciding what to eat.
With the boxwich, you don't have to worry about where to go or what to order,
you just have to press the button! The boxwich will randomly select a sandwich
from Jimmy John's and have it delivered to you!

The switch acts as a safety mechanism, so you have to flip it to arm the box
before it will work. We had several people just come up and immediately push
the button during HackNC, so it was very useful -- it saved me a lot of money.

The boxwich currently only selects from the Plain Slims because they're much
cheaper, but that is trivial to change.

## Hardware

We used a [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/gabrieltriggs/boxwich) to connect
the box to the internet.
