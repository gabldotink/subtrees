# Abou Scratch for Discord

Scratch For Discord™ (aka S4D™) is the Online Scratch-like IDE for Discord Bots.

Make your Discord bot using Scratch blocks! [Scratch For Discord](https://scratch-for-discord.com/) is an advanced fork of [discord-blocks](https://discordblocks.leondrolio.com/), and currently is being maintained by a nice group of people who do this in their free time! It was discontinued by its owner and we decided to continue working on it and make it a bigger project.

## So what is it?

It´s an easy way to make your discord bot without any knowledge of coding, you can also use it to learn JavaScript. It works using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) blocks, that you put in order to work.

### What can I even do?

You can do whatever you can imagine, there is a huge options from starting ping command to some stats managing bot.

### Is it free?

Scratch for Discord will forever be free about native javascript and discord.js library coverage.

### Is it still getting updated?

Currently it´s the most active from it´s existence.&#x20;

You can visit our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/TsQPMrNyBv), check Github repository or check in-app "changelog"
{% endhint %}

### Sounds good, But what's the catch?

The main catch is that you still have to use your brain, while it´s easier (for starters) to learn JS.

## What do I need?

* No coding skills
* PC to create your blocks
